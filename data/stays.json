Only in the morning we could not sleep in as there was loud construction noise during the day. The metro station is only a few minutes walk away and the city center is at walking distance. We also got a sweet welcome with Portuguese wine.",

He happily answered any questions and made it easy for me to arrive late at night and went above and beyond to help me have a good stay. \r\nThe apartment has been tastefully refurbished.  Extremely clean, and with all you could need for cooking.  The bed is so comfy.  The apartment is peaceful at night and I slept so well.   Some noise travels from Alex' apartment upstairs but it is only a little during the day.\r\nThe area is a bit out of the main hub of Williamsburg and Bushwick but everything is easily accessible with a short walk or the subway about 8 mins walk away.\r\nAlex left me a list of great stores, cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.  \r\nSome people may be concerned about the area at face value as it is a white minority but I felt safe at all times.  People seemed friendly.\r\n\r\n",

It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

The flight of stairs up to here place was a bit daunting but I can see why she lives up there.. It was beautiful! The room and whole place was clean, tidy and very welcoming. I saw Isabel twice, when I arrived and when I left, but it was perfect. \n\nThe facilities were great. The pressure in the shower was weak but it didn't bother me one bit. It is a bit noisy being in the heart of the city, but I can imagine it would be anywhere in this area. It was lovely to have a balcony, and the location was very convenient. Thanks.x",

        "txt": "Isa is a very lovely, sensitive, artistic and gorgeous person. She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana",

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n",

Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned. Hope to be seeing Isabel and her welcoming surroundings again one day ",

Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros.

Thank you Nihat. \nRegarding the apartment, it is exactly as described. The room is nice and bed is comfortable. It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk. As normal as it is in Istanbul, there is a short hill you need to walk to get to the square, which was totally fine with us. \n\nIn general, next time I visit Istanbul I would first check the availability with Nihat before searching others.",

I have informed the householder at once. When we arrived at the airport, we could not find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n ",

L'aria condizionata funzionava e rinfrescava bene tutto l'appartamento. L'unico problemino c'è stato con la porta del bagno che è stato facile chiudere, ma non più riaprire, ma c'è stato subito un pronto intervento da parte dei responsabili dell'appartamento, che hanno aiutato ad uscire la persona che era rimasta chiusa all'interno. Salvo questo però Il quartiere era tranquillo , c'erano vari baretti attorno e anche dei piccoli centri commerciali ( di tipo alimentare ). Era in oltre possibile raggiungere a piedi vari bar dove potersi divertire. I taxi per arrivare nel centro della movida variano con i prezzi dai 5 ai 7 euro a corsa. La fermata della metro era a 5 min a piedi dall'appartamento. Dal centro partiva una navetta che portava direttamente all'aeroporto per soli 4 euro e 90. ",

I would only say that the check out time of 11am is a bit early, especially for a city when you can have dinner quite late... although upon our request, Regina allowed us nicely to stay until 12pm.\r\nThey were two sets of keys which was very convenient for a big group. \r\nI have suggested to regina that it would be great to have a few more amenities provided such as toilet paper and coffee/tea for example, but overall we were very pleased with our stay at Regina's place.

There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay.

The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).  Overall, the apartment was a nice, comfortable bargain for family travel - not the most modern, but charming and fully met our needs.",

        "txt": "麻雀虽小,五脏俱全!很干净也很舒适,感觉有如在自己家似的｡下次如果想尝试在九龍岛住还会想要和 Michelle&May 定香港住宿｡谢谢她的亲切友善与小礼物｡(Hope I'm using the appropriate chinese words!)\r\n\r\nIt was a very pleasant first experience with Airbnb with Michelle&May. Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host's guidance.\r\n\r\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \r\n\r\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn't use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There's wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn't watch the few channels we wanted to. \r\n\r\nIt's a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you're a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \r\n\r\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\r\n\r\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn't mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)",

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

The appliances were all new and the apartment in general was in great condition.  There are 4 separate bedrooms each with a desk, closet and drawers.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately \"at home.\" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.  I would be thrilled to have future booking accompanied with Flatbook service and can't wait to use them again!!!!",

Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro.

        "txt": "What a wonderful holiday and a wonderful place to stay! We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.\r\nThanks Orestes, it was fabulous x",

We met Orestes briefly, as he was out of town most of the time, and he is extremely hospitable and helpful.  Chris, who was around the rest of the time, was also kind and available for any questions.\r\nThe location is convenient to a grocery store, decent diner, and several subway lines; it's pretty simple to get to Queens, Brooklyn, or Manhattan.\r\nFuture guests should be aware that while the guest room itself might be non-smoking, the rest of the house isn't.  Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)\r\nOn whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice.",

L'appartement est très bien situé, à deux pas du métro! Les escaliers de la résidence étaient bien étroits, et il y à 5 étages à monter! Mais nous étions prévenu, c'est écrit sur l'annonce, ça nous a permis de bien digérer le repas avant de dormir!

До метро Poble Sec три минуты ходьбы.Для нас оказался необычным подъезд, лестница и правда узкая и высокая, об этом все тут пишут, если есть проблемы со здоровьем, лучше не рисковать. Удачное расположение квартиры позволяет экономить на проезде, до площади Испании и фонтана Монжуик десять минут, до площади Каталонии чуть подальше. Рядом много кафе и магазинов. Из-за рабочего графика Монс, мы видели ее очень редко, поэтому фактически вся квартира была в нашем распоряжении. Это был наш первый опыт с airbnb и он оказался удачным.",

Large sunny room with comfy queen mattress. Fun and funky decor, nice little terrace and ktichen.  Couple of things: 1)  there are two bathrooms- one with toilet, the other with sink and bathtub.  The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!  Maybe I'm fussier than my younger reviewers, but these are important to note.  Otherwise, a very nice stay with friendly and knowledgable hosts.\r\n",

Alugar um apartamento em outra cidade, outro país, além de ser mais barato do que hotel, possibilita uma maior interação com os moradores locais e um maior conhecimento sobre o seu modo de vida. Como são os supermercados e as padarias, o que vendem ali ? qual é o dia a dia da população?  Além disto não há horário para o café da manhã e posso fazer um lanche ou almoço se não quiser ir a um restaurante.\r\nProcuro trazer as minhas experiências de hospedagem para o meu apartamento, pois quero que o hóspede se sinta confortável, em casa.\r\nAlém de gostar muito de viajar, adoro ler e ouvir música e pretendo com o dinheiro que ganho hospedando, poder me hospedar mais pelo mundo a fora.

        "txt": "Our time in Rio staying at Dejanira's apartment was fantastic, I personally don't think that the photos do the property justice and feel that in person the property is actually bigger! The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn't feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn't the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day's exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \"good morning\" and \"good evening\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira's apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again.",

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned. I texted the owner several...",

Do not believe the other guest review... nothing was doctored up, the furniture was great, we used the AC whenever we wanted to.  There were plenty of sand toys, snorkel gear, etc.  There were no issues.  \n\nMy sister and I were on a quest to see as many turtles on Maui as possible and we saw more than 5 everyday right in front of the condo!  They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.  Francesco was also so easy to work with, always responded quickly when we had questions.  Could not have asked for a better host.",

        "txt": "I would generally recommend staying at this Maui Airbnb. We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own. Anyway, over all, a really great place - great location and a nice quiet spot in Maui. :)",

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier.",

This might be beyond the owner's control, but something we noticed while we were there.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay in Francesco's place - can't beat the location.",

Home is right on the shore, but you can easily access the beach to the left or right (just a short walk). Snorkeling out front was wonderful. Lots of fish and we even saw sea turtles. My grandma wasn't able to snorkel, but she loved sitting on the Lanai watching the waves with beautiful views of the islands across (I think it is both Molokai AND Lanai?). She even got to see a sea turtle right out front! Francesco was very helpful, friendly and quick to respond with anything we needed. Location was unbeatable too! Close to Front Street in Lahaina, Grocery store 3 minutes away, lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. It was close to everything but still quiet and private. My family loved Maui and we're already planning our trip for 2019 and hoping to stay at Francescos place again! Thanks again for letting us stay at your beautiful Maui home!",

I teach middle school math at an international school here in Hong Kong and have enjoyed the lifestyle of living and working in this vibrant city. \r\n\r\nHong Kong has always had plenty of options to stay active. I've played in an expat softball league here for many years and still try to get out as much as I can. When I first arrived, I did a few of the popular hikes, but not so much anymore unfortunately. There are still some places in Hong Kong that I would like to explore and I also find the city to be a great hub for travelling throughout southeast Asia. \r\n\r\nI'm new to Airbnb and open to suggestions on making your stay in Hong Kong an enjoyable experience. Nice to meet you!",

For a straight-shot to the Sheng Wan station, take a couple long flights of stairs. If you have luggage & want to avoid that, use the Central station (or Uber) but keep in mind it is always very crowded there. \n\nApartment was spacious for Hong Kong standards. Shower pressure was strong & stayed hot through long hair washing. Living room has surround sound system & English channels to watch TV. There's an extra closet room for hanging clothes. \n\nOverall, great place to stay as compared to other HK apartments. \n\nAlso note, not all amenities at Dan's place are for communal use. This was not listed under House Rules nor noted anywhere. I was surprised to receive a note after check-out that an already open beverage was not for share although fridge was listed as an amenity.

If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. \nWe had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. \nI highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong. I and my husband went out for a drink every night and found awesome bars and restaurants. We could have done it easily as the place is so close to it. \n",

The pool has been perfect for our grandson who is turning 4- he can go underwater and still stand up! We’ve all taken the kitchen scraps to the pig and watched him dominate, used the swings, clothesline, and have great praise for the outside bathroom. There is a high minded curatorial process going on here. Everything feels as if it were chosen for a use in this dreamy world of a bygone time. Thank you for making it possible for us to be here for 6 nights. I am so appreciative of your vision, this feeling of old Hawaii.\nSincerely and with Aloha,\nAnna Marie Hamilton",

The sidewalks are broad and evenly graded which makes for easy walking, and clean.\n\nPublic buses are frequent and easy to use, and there is an underground Metro station nearby within easy walking distance.\n\nDavid was what I would call a super host. His apartment was well equipped with every modern convenience and very clean. It was also very well stocked with food; bread, milk, juice, fresh fruit, butter, coking oil, etc., including a bottle of wine.\n\nHe patiently and carefully explained the works of every appliance in the apartment, including the use of the television features, and he made sure you are aware that he is available for any question later on. Communicating in English was not a problem.\n\nWe greatly appreciated the considerable time he spent providing us with detailed explanation of all the major attractions of Barcelona and how to get there. His Guest Guidebook includes all the details one could possibly ever need while in Barcelona, from managing emergency situations, using public transport, maps, to restaurants, shops, museums and all major attractions. Our visit to Barcelona was made much easier because of the book, and we learned a lot more.\n\nWe would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to use David's place.

It is no surprise that the owner has been awarded the Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence.  \n\nDavid keeps in touch, checking in to see if/what there is anything we need, in addition to recommending places to visit.  It's not just lip service.  For example, we suggested he consider adding a mat in the bathtub, which could be a bit slippery.  Later that day, DONE.\n\nFor example, when it was was time to vacate after our ten-day stay, we asked if would do us the favour of arranging for a mini-van to pick us up at 5:30am, as we were taking a train on to San Sebastian, and couldn't risk any misunderstanding if we tried booking this ourselves.  After checking around, David came back with an answer.  The going rate was too high and he was still looking to find us much more reasonable transportation.  He DID.\n\nThis beautifully decorated, two-bedroom apartment is everything as described, well-equipped, well-stocked, clean and comfortable with a lovely balcony and close to all amenities.  \n\nDo we recommend it, most definitely YES.",

Ready to tell us everything. You can ask him about even unexpected things about your stay and be sure he will find an answer in a very short time. How to get to any museum or tourist attraction, where to go in Barcelona,  what to do with kids, where to go to a whole day journey outside the town etc. He's knowledge about Catalonia's history and Catalan architecture is unbelievable. We spending a whole week in Barcelona with our little daughter. She was so happy possessing her own room so she would not go outside. She told us every day she find herself as a princess. She's eight and believe me, she will never said this in our flat. The apartment is amazing. Full of every conveniences you need. Honestly, we haven't got in our own kitchen so many stuff. The apartment is stylish and cosy. So you could feel very comfortable here during your stay. If you need coffee you could make it in many ways, you could cooked here, prepared a dishes, and what it's really really awesome, you could spend a whole evening or night on a lovely terrace. But who wants to stayed on a terrace in Barcelona? If you decided to explore a town, you will find in David's apartment a special guide book which he prepared for his guests. You can't miss it. It's huge as an Encyclopedia Britannica. Neighbours are friendly, you will find a nice bakery and full equipped stores just around the corner. Location is just excellent. Lovely beach is a few blocks from your apartment, underground station just five minutes by walk. Bus stop is on the same corner as a David's apartment. It's hard to believe, but yes. You will find there everything what every high-maintenance resident need. So, if you really want to enjoy your stay at Barcelona, choose this unusual opportunity for living. You will not regret. We are sure! We fell in love with Barcelona, we fell in love with David and we plan to go back as soon as we can. What about next week?",

One small thing, the curtains are quite sheer over the full-length windows which makes the whole place bright & airy, but if you're used to sleeping in darkness then I recommend bringing eyeshades.",

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

        "txt": "This was my first trip to Hawaii and having used Airbnb successfully before, I was looking forward to our stay! While I can usually overlook most shortcomings, the list was too many to ignore here. Wide angle pictures & professionally written listing descriptions will impress most - however, here are some takes from my REAL customer experience at the 414 condo:\n\n\"We will provide you with a special code to access the condo after you are booked and paid in full.\"\n\n- After a 13 day stay, we were charged a \"half day rate\" for a late checkout for 5 hours over our contracted stay. During our last day, we ended up being locked out of the condo. Thankfully the late checkout fee was refunded due to this situation. Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.\n\n\"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable.\"\n\n- The AC unit is a measly 12\" by 32\" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room & kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is \"comfortable\", then this might be the place for you.\n\n\"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds.\"  -- \"Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles.\"\n\n- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. \n\n\"This unit is spacious and bright.\"\n\n- Spacious? That's a stretch. But bright? You're absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). \n\nA POSITIVE NOTE:\nOne thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests. \n",

We report this to Tyler, he didn't reply, so we told his friend and then he was arguing with us and he said that I am complaining for no reason. He even suggested me to buy a refresher in Dollar store! \n\nWe were very upset, not only the bad smell, but also the dirty old quilt. We tried to take a nap, but people live on the second floor were laughing so loud and traffic outside was noisy. So we decided to move to a hotel. I asked Tyler about this, he didn't reply, but he sent another friend to reply us that he will give us full refund, and we can leave the key in the room then move to a hotel. But after we arrived at the hotel, Tyler finally replied us and said he won't refund us!

Thursday was my actual birthday and this almost had us packing up and heading home - we were minutes away from cancelling the weekend as we had no way of getting in to the house we had booked for 12 guests. We then get inside and everyone starts to arrive and we all shower and use the toilets. By the time we come out the smell of raw sewage is so unbearable that we can't use the balcony for the dinner we had planned or open any windows on a hot day in a house that has no air con (not that air con was ever listed or promised however). The smell only got worse throughout the weekend as we continued to use the bathrooms. 6 out of 12 guests chose to leave on Friday as a result - ruining the weekend we had planned for my birthday. Two of the couples who left had travelled interstate for this. So they had paid for 3 nights and only got to stay 1 in rooms that stunk of sewage. This could have and should have been resolved on Friday or Saturday - but no solution was offered and we were expected to stay in a house that stunk of sewage. On top of this on Friday, as we bring items down from the car into the house we place two cases on a shelf along the kitchen wall and it comes off completely and lands on my foot. After looking at how it was constructed, a 30-50kg shelf was screwed together by 4 small screws and was never constructed to hold any sort of weight, making it a danger to guests. And lastly, the alarm. At 2.30am on the Saturday morning the house alarm (that we had been told did not work) began going off and woke everyone in the house. The four surrounding suburbs encountered a blackout and as a result the alarm went to auxiliary power and then went into alarm (the blackout is obviously not the owners fault) The alarm continued to go off for an hour and there was no information anywhere as to how to make it stop. We were left to figure this out for ourselves. The number we called inside the panel had no idea, the host was not contactable and the lady he put us in touch with suggested \"we push a couple of buttons\". The house should not have been rented out with the sewage pump the way it was and the host should have information on hand for his alarm system. We know that the host MAY not have known the pump was broken, but we did make him aware as soon as we noticed it within a couple of hours of arriving and no solution was offered for the three day stay.

Not only it is so clean and safe for kids, its convenient location allows us to return for nap and rest when kids are tired between our busy holiday schedules. Wilson is so approachable and very thoughtful in many details.\r\nClean linens, towels, kitchenware, clothes washing powder, indoor storable clothes liner, refills of every consumable daily essential items eg toilet papers, tissues etc.\r\nThere are some stairs upon entry into lobby/lift of the building but it is a very common feature in Hong Kong. You can open the French-door-type glass doors fully before you enter with big luggages. The building guards/administrators on duty are very friendly too.\r\nSurprisingly, it's so quiet and comfortable to sleep, considering its prime location in one of the busiest parts of Hong Kong. Eating, shopping, sightseeing...all within walking distance or so easy for additional transportation when preferred.\r\nThank you for making our stay in Hong Kong so memorable.\r\nStrongly recommended!",

        "txt": "We didn't meet Wilson but he made things easy the day before checking in Wilson had sent me a email with all the info I needed to get into his place which was awesome. The location was great it was close to the MTR/public transportation, restaurants, market, etc... The only con to the location is that it was a little hard to get a taxi because coming out of the building cars are not allowed to stop in that area so you would have to walk a bit when taking/coming from a taxi. This has nothing to do with wilson but I thought I would mention it anyways the elevator in this building is extremely slow. The apartment was decent, it didn't wow me or anything but as expected places in HK are small. For a group of 9 it was a bit tight but that didn't bother us since we were out most of the time. The apartment looks pretty much like the pictures there is one thing I would like to say is I wish Wilson would have taken pictures of the second bathroom to his place kus it was tiny. I'm a really tiny girl and even I had a hard time in there. So that probably would have changed my mind on picking his place to stay because we were really looking for a 2 bathroom place. I mean yes the small restroom is considered as 1 but it was so tiny that we didnt even use the shower in it kus it  was tiny but oh wells. Overall our stay was fine but I did feel like the floors could have been a bit more clean.  ",

The living room and bedrooms are renovated, with the bathroom and kitchen being a bit older. Pictures are accurate.  Apartment very centrally located - 5 min walk from SOGO, 5 min walk to Times Square, etc. It is situated on top floor of a building that has businesses on the bottom 4 floors. Elevators are small and slow, and entrance is directly on a busy street. Wilson is a great host as he was quick to respond to our requests. One of the ACs broke down and was fixed the next day. Overall great stay - great alternative as opposed to staying at hotel for two weeks (we saved lots of money)",

I could even partly see New Years fireworks from windows. \n\nApartment concierges were at a ground floor 24 hours. They open the entrance door when you come home. Some of them can communicate in English. They are all kind and helpful.\n\nCarmen was super kind and communicative host. Her indication was accurate and helpful. She kindly left an octopus card for visitors to charge and use. \n\nThere is a washing machine in a listing but HongKong was too humid to dry laundry fast.  You can use a laundry shop next to the apartment. They wash and clean your laundry in a day.\n\nThe location was only a few minutes from a tram station. \nWalkable distance from Central and Causeway Bay. \n\nThere are many towns in HongKong but I am totally satisfied with staying in Wanchai. \nWanchai has modern skyscrapers, hipster attractions, and daily local markets and small restaurants.  St Francis street looked very sophisticated and I didn’t feel unsafe. In front of the apartment, there are rainbow stairs which looks like an Instagram shooting spot and a lot of foreign people were taking photos. If you are a vegetarian, I strongly recommend a restaurant “天然齋 Green Veggie” 15min from the apartment.",

We were even provided with a welcoming gift! \nThere are, however, two downsides: the apartment is not equipped with an airconditioner or fan (which is not disastrous, but it can get pretty hot if you're not used to Portugese summers), and sounds from upstairs neighbours and the busy road it lies on can be heard at night. If you're a light sleeper, I suggest taking soundproof earplugs with you. \nOtherwise, it's a beautiful apartment if you want to enjoy both the city center of Porto and the beach!",

Despite of my insistance he paid for my dinner, dessert a nice tea afterward and paid for the minibus to the shisha place. Frankly, it might have exceeded the rent I paid. I wanted to go to Kurdistan but non of information was available in English he called the bus company for me and then he came with me to the bus terminal then he barganed on my behalf and I got a cheaper ticket as the result. He didn't leave until he made sure I went on my bus safely. In my return also his friend came with me to Taksim to make sure that I'm getting the right bus to Sabiha airport. I highly recommand him if you want a host who is also your tour guide and freind. Also the prices in the shops are considerably cheaper near his place rather than touristic area like Taksim and you are a 2 TL away from Taksim, so his place is ideal in any sense.",

He gave us Istanbul kart (public transport card in Istanbul). He even woke up at 4 in the morning to make sure our early morning Taxi has arrived on time. He provided pointers for places to visit and eat. He recommended a restaurant nearby and we had the best Iskinder kebab there!\r\n\r\nGaziosmanpasa bus stand is few minutes walk from Kubilay's place. Gaziosmanpasa has direct buses to Taxim Square and Eminönü (all the main tourist destinations are near this stop). \r\n\r\nIf you want to stay in a non-touristy place, eat best food, want to do some shopping at local price, want to experience Turkish hospitality definitely stay at Kubilay's.\r\n\r\nThanks for wonderful time Kubilay!",

The accommodation is clean with everything you need. It's quite close to the city center and cheap to get there with a transport card that Kubilay provides. Kubilay is an open-minded well-travelled person who will give you all necessary information on sightseeing and not only. Though my mum doesn't speak English, he managed to explain to her where to find traditional hammam and massage so she and her friend were very happy. Thanks for a great stay, Kubilay!\r\n\r\nЗамечательный заботливый хозяин! Четко объяснил, как проехать к нему от аэропорта, встретил у метро, был все время на связи. Комнаты чистые со всем необходимым. Кубилай предоставил моей маме и ее подруге выбор: спать в одной комнате с 2-мя кроватями или в разных комнатах. Несмотря на то, что моя мама не говорит по-английски, Кубилай сумел объяснить ей, где находится хамам и массаж, чем она была очень довольна! Расположение квартиры удобное, добираться до центра легко и недорого с транспортной картой, которую предоставляет Кубилай. На завтрак Кубилай предложил нам фрукты, орехи, сыр и вкусный чай со сладостями. Спасибо ему большое за радушный прием, информационную поддержку и готовность помочь в любую минуту!",

Le logement est propre, confortable et bien équipé (bonne connection internet; lave linge & sèche linge; bureau pour travailler...). La chambre  est plutôt spacieuse. Le rapport qualité prix est très bien selon moi. J'ai pu profiter de la terrasse sur le toit avant qu'il ne fasse trop froid. L'appartement est bien situé, il y a des parcs et des rues marchande pas très loin, les autres rues marchande ne sont pas très loin non plus, j'y allais souvent à pied (Mont Royal que j'aime bien est à 30min de marche). Il y a de bon restaurant et de très bon café à moins de 5 minutes de marche. Le metro est à environ à 10-15 minutes. Il y à aussi une station de vélo et une bonne épicerie à quelque minutes.\r\nLe quartier est sympa, la rue est calme. Pour ceux qui veulent faire du shopping ou du lèche vitrine il faudra surement prendre le metro pour aller un peu plus loin. Mais facilement accessible avec le metro.\r\nTrès bonne première expérience airbnb. \r\n",

        "txt": "Снимали номер с 3 по 9 ноября 2017 втроем - 2 взрослых и ребенок 9 лет. \nМестоположение и район.\nНайти гостиницу очень просто. Если добираетесь сами, то выходить надо на трамвайной остановке Баязит, перейти на другую улицу, найти вывеску Burger King  и по этой улочке идти прямо вниз, никуда не сворачивая, ища вывеску гостиницы (она будет справа). \nТеперь о самом районе. Гостиница находится на торговой и оживленной улице. Первое впечатление - как будто ты попала на рынок, становится тревожно. Но потом уже понимаешь, что собственно это не совсем рынок - это магазины по оптовой торговле обувью. Я несколько раз проходила по этой улочке одна - все нормально - никто меня за руки не хватал, никуда не зазывал - здесь люди торгуют оптом, потому я как покупатель не особо интересна. Прогулка по этой улице до гостиницы занимает минуты 3. Зато поднявшись до трамвайной остановке Баязит, ты попадаешь сразу в исторический центр (Гранд Базар) и можешь прогуляться по одной из самых красивых улиц старого Константинополя. Пешком минут за 10 (может меньше, очень близко) доходим до площади Султанахмет, где в вашем распоряжении сразу несколько достопримечательностей - Храм Святой Софии, Цистерна Базилика, Голубая мечеть, колонны, рядом тоже Дворец Топкапы. Так что в плане местоположения гостиницы - все очень хорошо. И - ночью тихо, никто не мешает спать. В  5 утра кажется проходит молитва - её слышно, но еле-еле, я просто чутко сплю. Мы жили в номере 401 - на верхнем этаже. Из окна открывается вид на Мраморное море со множеством кораблей и крыши соседних домов.\nЗавтраки.\nКаждый день одинаковые, но очень вкусные. Из горячего - яйца, картофель фри, омлет кажется (вроде без молока, не знаю, но вкусно), чай, кофе. Нарезки - огурцы, помидоры, оливки, маслины, 2 вида сыра, колбаса-ветчина, жареные кабачки и перцы, йогурт, хлопья. В кувшинах молоко и еще что-то типа цветного разведенного сока.\nНомер.\nКартинка соответствует полностью нами увиденному. Мебель неновая, но красивая и добротная, и видно, что дорогая. Матрасы толстые и удобные. Белье чистое и не пахнет хлоркой. Могу только добавить, что есть еще мини-бар, чайник электрический и чашки с блюдцами, тройник (поразительно!).  В ванне на троих человек - 5 тюбиков геля и один шампуня, три кусочка мыла и туалетная бумага. Полотенца также предоставляются. Есть сейф, проверили - работает, я так поняла он предоставляется бесплатно....вот только его к шкафу забыли прикрутить -\n спокойно взял под мышку и пошел. Посторонних и неприятных запахов нет.\nВ целом.\nГостиница очень приятная, тихая, уютная. Соотношения цена-качество оптимальное. Рекомендую данную гостиницу.",

First off, not cool, secondly he didn't offer to give us anything in return for this major inconvenience.  The other place was not up to our standards and we requested a refund which he made in cash.  This was kind of him, but still we want things to run smoothly.  Vacationing is amazing, but it's a costly affair that always adds additional stresses and one stress we like to avoid is accommodation issues.",

Very quaint and clean little condo, had a homey feeling right away! The beach that is a short walk away was one of my favorite beaches during our whole trip, and we got to walk it every morning!

Restaurants and shops and aquarium are walkable, and most of the spots on the island you want to be at are no more than 20 minutes away by car. We found the location so convenient and flexible, and were able to do everything we wanted. \n\nThe space is even nicer than it looks in the photos, immaculately kept and with everything you could want. It even has tons of goodies for cooking - salts and spices and even olive oil! The box of beach goodies - chairs, boogie boards, a cooler - were super handy and we used them a ton, saved us money too. \n\nIf you're worried about not having a beach view, don't be. The mountain view is gorgeous, and you can walk to the beach in minutes. \n\nMahalo, Ralph! We'd stay here again <3",

Look no further than this condo because it is a very short walk to the harbor which will cut back travel time and save you money on parking!! I highly recommend dropping by beach bums also located at the harbor for drinks and some delicious BBQ!!! Nice central location on the island makes for easy travel and good time.

We literally watched people line the beach in front of our lanai each night to watch the gorgeous sunsets - we didn't need to do that however, we could watch it from the lanai!  We're going to miss that. Folks from the north should be aware that there is no A/C here, which is common in Lahanai apparently, we learned, because of the strong trade winds which cool things considerably. The hosts were very responsive and gracious. This was a very nice experience and we look forward to our next Maui adventure!",

Kihei market was merely a 2 minute walk away as was the surf school where you can rent out paddle boards or surf boards and other gear. Since it is centrally located, driving to other places in Maui was also convenient. \n\nHospitality was outstanding - we knew where we wanted to go but the apt had a Maui guide book on the coffee table for quick reference. There were great amenities to play Music, a nice bookshelf with various reads if you just want to read by the beach and chairs to take to the beach  to relax in between your snorkeling/swimming excursions. \n\nThe views - oh my god. The photos do not do it justice. We had sweeping views of the pacific and saw early morning paddle-boarders, surfers and sea turtles right from the balcony! Im sure if you come during the winter months, you can watch whales literally while drinking your morning coffee. No need to go to an expensive touristy bar to get that perfect Hawaiian sunset :) \n\nI don't know what else to say. Highly recommend for a great time.",

The heritage house, very well loved by the owners, is all at once comfortable/cosy, charming and full of wonders… some delicious like: fresh herbs, lemon/orange trees growing in the garden. The'Platypus\" bedroom with its timber walls, vintage lacy mosquito net, clean bed linen & soft towels, made us feel very snug. Ann had even placed some fresh lavender stems on our pillows! We explored the island during the day, hanged at the beach… It felt like the time had stopped for a while. Then, coming back to the house, we were welcomed at night by Ann cooking up a FEAST, literally. She put so much thoughts into the menu and what would please us! The dinner with Ann and her husband was lovely and very much fun. Needless to say that we slept like babies. The next day morning brunch was another delicious meal served on the sunny balcony overlooking the vegetation and the river.

We had booked and paid correctly, it appears there may have been a problem with the Air BNB site. However, from this point on staying there became very uncomfortable.\nOver the next couple of days there were more problems. She could not tell us the wifi password, so we were unable to use the wifi. She told us we could not use the air conditioning. Finally, she refused us access to the kitchen to heat up our dinner, and told us we could not eat in the house, so we ended up eating cold pies in the garden at night. \nIt was so uncomfortable we decided to leave early, and did not stay the last night. \n",

        "txt": "Alison and Adam were my saviours in Sydney. our logistics officer booked us an hotel in the middle of nowhere in Ryde, claiming that it was the nearest point to Sydney Olympic Park as i had to attend the WPC14 with my colleagues. When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.\r\n\r\nAlison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...\r\nBy the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i'm paying the right cab fee. \r\n\r\nWhat can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \r\n\r\nFelt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). \r\n\r\nNow the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\r\n\r\nAll in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \r\n\r\n ",

Since the appartment is in the city center there is no fabulos view from none of the windows - but this does not matter at all.\r\n \r\nThere is also a Nespresso coffee machine in the modern kitchen (bring the capsules by your one or there is a Nespresso shop 100m away).\r\n \r\nWe can fully recomand this special appartment and Lluis as perfect host in this wunderful city.\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!\r\n \r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n\r\n *   * \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDas Appartment ist in unmittelbarer Nähe vom öffentlichen Verkehr und der grossen Einkaufsstrasse \"Passeig de Gràcia\" mit unzähligen Läden, Cafes und Restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeal für einen Sightseeing-Aufenthalt in Barcelona, da zentral gelegen (ca. 10 min zu Fuss zur Plaça Catalunya, 2 min zum Taxi-Stand und Bus-Haltestellen).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir waren zu 5. für drei Tage in Lluis Wohnung und haben uns sofort sehr wohl gefühlt. Lluis war bei der Schlüsselübergabe bereits vor Ort und hat uns gute Tipps für Barcelona gegeben. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDie Wohnung ist neu renoviert, modern eingerichtet und hat wunderschöne alte Böden und Stuckaturen in manchen Zimmern.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine automatische Lüftung: Die Temperatur kann manuell eingestellt werden (sehr angenehm).\r\n\r\nDer verglaste Raum („Wintergarten“) ist ein zusätzlicher Raum mit Aussicht auf den Innenhof (die Aussicht ist jetzt nicht wirklich atemberaubend, aber es ist sehr gemütlich). Eine schöne Aussicht gibt es von keinem Fenster aus, da sich die Wohnung Mitten in der Stadt befindet - Stört aber nicht.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine Nespresso-Kaffee-Maschine (Kapseln selber mitbringen oder 100m von der Wohnung gibt’s einen Nespresso-Shop).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir können die Wohnung und Lluis als Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen.\r\n\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n",

Third, the apartment faces Madison Ave, so it is rather loud. In addition, the windows are not well sealed so it gets cold/hot easily. Overall, considering what you get, the apartment is overpriced. In addition to get the key, you have to travel across the city to pick it up - very inconveniently.",

Yo mismo vivo en un edificio antiguo.el apartamento estaba limpio excepto por la nevera, que tuvimos que limpiarla a fondo\nCalefacción y aire acondicionado. Muy necesarios los dos porque las temperaturas son un poco extremas.\nWiFi muy bueno, Potente (llegaba hasta la parada del autobús) y muy veloz. Televisión con múltiples canales\nLos quince primeros días estuvimos cuatro personas (mis dos hijos) y estuvimos un poco justos (sofá-cama) pero después una pareja, y perfecto.\nLe vendría bien al apartamento una mano de pintura.\nEs tuvimos mes y medio y NYC es maravilloso, el sitio y el apartamento me encanto, salvo pequeñas cosas, y el anfitrion fue muy amable ya que nos dejó hacer el check out a la 1:00 pm.\nLa comunicación fue siempre por email",

The room itself was super clean, comfortable and perfect for a short holiday in Hong Kong. It had everything I needed - AC, little bathroom with shower, fresh towel everyday, shampoo and a big comfortable bed. You also feel really safe as you can only get into the guesthouse and room with a special keycard. The staff was super helpful too and so was Natalie. I only met her in person once, but she is incredibly friendly and really makes sure you have a pleasant stay. I can recommend the guesthouse for those who travel by themselves and need a quiet room to come back to in the midst of bustling Hong Kong. Thanks a lot, Natalie! All the best, Juliana",

Not only was the place exactly what we needed but Paul is a genuinely nice, kind, interesting human being and it has been a pleasure to get to know him. We stayed as a couple for just over a month and miss it already. Paul showed us around the neighbourhood when we first got there and was easily contactable thereafter.\r\n\r\nPaul's place is a unique gem decorated with his quirky eye for colour, style and collectible treasures. It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\r\n\r\nFor us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping! Would stay again in a flash!",

I was in NYC for 2 weeks at Columbia and the location was just a few blocks away. I didn't want to deal with transit in the AM, although that would not have been a big issue anyway.  Plus, it's right off broadway (the broadway that has shows) so subways access was great. Since it's a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul's residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!  He was totally respectful of my privacy and wasn't popping in or out during my stay.  I'm hopeful that if Teachers college has anymore trainings that I get to go to, Paul's place is available!",

The location is outstanding. Such a lovely upper west side block, across the street and around the corner from Columbia. I was visiting my son who is a student there. Even if Columbia wasn't your destination, Paul's apartment is one block from lovely Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Morningside park is a few blocks to the east. Central Park North and Cathedral Parkway are 5-10 minutes away. The 1 train stops 2-4 blocks away. The UWS is very gracious. The pace is less frenetic which is a nice thing at the end of a day of NYC touring. Yet the nearness of Columbia gives the neighborhood a youthful hip vibe. And Columbia's campus is outstanding; lovely and compact. I felt safe coming and going from Paul's building. The building was well maintained. The hallway outside his door wasn't dark and depressing. There is a laundry in the basement and a garbage chute in the hall on his floor. Paul's apartment is decorated with an artist's eye; the furniture, art, even the plates and skillets, were beautiful, colorful, special. The kitchen/sitting room was filled with light! Everything was in its place. My bedroom had a very big, comfortable bed. The bed linens were soft; the colors were muted and restful. There was plenty of drawer and closet space. The table lighting was exceptional. I had a lovely view of a church and Columbia outside my bedroom window. Paul was so kind to welcome me very early due to my 5a arrival into JFK on a red eye from SF. He was quickly responsive when I requested my stay. He met me and welcomed me into his home. He made me tea, fruit and nuts. He gave me plenty of towels and wash clothes. He gave me a shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries. I unpacked, showered (plenty of hot water), and headed out to my first meeting. Paul was lovely to talk to, yet respectful of my privacy. He welcomed both of my young adult children into his home. My daughter (who is graduating from NYU) cooked 2 breakfasts in Paul's kitchen. She so enjoyed his window seat in his kitchen. My son lingered and did schoolwork at the kitchen table. Paul's space was so much more gracious than a dorm room! Paul even printed out my boarding pass when I was out and about. He also printed 36 pages of work that I had completed while spending the day in the libraries at Columbia and the cafes near Columbia while my son wrote a paper. Making that personal connection with Paul enhanced my stay. But he was so quiet and gracious that guests who want to keep to themselves would also be comfortable.

We work from home and we are very fast replying guest messages when we are not here to answer in person. Despite our apartment being small, we have a comfortable size bedroom with a double bed and many cosy pillows so you can relax and rest after exploring Sydney! Also, we are 15 minutes walking distance to Coogee Beach (our favourite!).\r\n\r\nAs a traveller: \r\nI prefer quiet and relaxing homes and when travelling I barely stay on my Airbnb room as I am constantly exploring. I like to chat with my hosts to find out the best places to eat and see from a local's point of view as well as building friendship with my hosts.\r\nI either travel alone or with my Italian husband Claudio.

Next day she knocked and had 2 beach chairs on her shoulder, not the flimsy ones, the good ones....we thought that was incredible. The place is not the Hyatt, but comfy and clean. Our room was big enough for us,shower and toilet in the room, all was perfect. We could use the kitchen, which we did every morning. Well, what else is there to say? I told her, whenever we visit Maui, we will stay with her.

Falta de limpieza absoluta en toda la casa que hacía muy incómoda su estancia y más con niños pequeños. El sofá donde supuestamente se podía dormir, tenía una gran mancha que ni se habían molestado en intentar limpiarla. Solo había un único armario recubierto de moho para guardar la ropa, que evidentemente no pudimos utilizar. La ducha estaba negra, picada y oxidada, lo que nos tocó limpiar a nosotros y desinfectarla un poco para poderla utilizar. La cocina llena cubierta por una capa de grasa que la hacía inútil para cocinar cualquier cosa. Escaleras hacia abajo completamente empinadas y estrechas.  Nada más llegar ni rastro de Regina o Juan, nos atendió una persona que ni siquiera sabía hablar bien castellano, por lo que dudo mucho de la existencia de Juan y Regina. Es absolutamente indignante que cuando pagas el apartamento te cobran unos gastos de limpieza que no han efectuado. Para colmo nos cobraron 30 € en concepto de checking. La zona es tranquila aunque bastante alejada del metro, dado que tienes unas cuestas muy empinadas desde la parada más cernada de metro y luego toca subir cuesta arriba unos 15 minutos. De cara a los esfuerzos por parte del anfitrión, absolutamente ninguno. La persona que nos recibió ni siquiera sabía indicarnos donde estaba la tienda más cercana, un parking donde poder dejar el coche e incluso la parada de metro más cernada. Soy usuario de esta web desde hace tiempo, he visitado otros países de Europa usándola y ha sido con creces la peor experiencia que he tenido. Me siento completamente estafado.",

Overall, it was like spending a weekend at a friend's place.  The neighborhood was quite busy with people and shops until late into the night, but the room was quiet, clean and comfortable.  I slept like a baby.  I would only suggest that you confirm your check in and check out times with them in advance so as to avoid any confusion.

Die Dusche befand sich in einem Gemeinschaftsbad. \n\nNebst Badetüchern und Strandstühlen waren auch Shampoo und Douche bereitgestellt.\n\nFür Dollar 1.50 konnte man die Maschmaschine inkl. Maschmittel benützen. Gedeckter Parkplatz vorhanden. 5-minütiger Fussmarsch bis ins Zentrum von Paia. \n\n",

The apartment is beautifully appointed, fresh spotless linen, a bowl of fruit, chocolates, and even an array of teabags and biscuits to have with my coffee. Such a lovely surprise. It's a spacious apartment with two beautiful bathrooms and amazing views. Even a large balcony with deck chairs. This apartment truly had everything we needed. There was a chemist near the ground floor doors, and a convenience store as well; coffee shops and cafes are nearby, and an excellent DFO shopping centre nearby (within walking distance; 1.3km I think).

He sent us a detailed \"Welcome Packet\" which included very useful tips for our Maui adventure. The condo was 100% clean and included everything one may need to prepare meals and have an enjoyable and relaxing stay. Prior to our arrival, he actually replaced most all the kitchen items such as silverware, dishes, cooking utensils, pots and pans, etc. The furnishings (including the beds) were extremely comfortable and the panoramic view, condo grounds and beach were SPECTACULAR!!! It was especially nice having a casual open-air restaurant on the property.

They always responded me in a swift manner with good solutions to all of my minor issues (including the early arrival, coffee machine repair, cleaning service question and light bulb request). \nI liked the apartment very much. It was convenient to do anything in the city and quiet and comfortable to sleep at night. To highlight the convenience, I want to note that the nearest supermarket is just one or two blocks away (to the north) and pubs and restaurants are also a block away (to the south). Some may worry about bugs at such location, but during my 40-day stay, I did not have any bug issues. \nThe only possible setbacks I can think of are the tiny kitchen sink and occasional odor from outside. \nThe kitchen sink is certainly small although this place has a dishwasher. So, for a short stay and people who do not cook very much will not have any problems. However, if you want to do dishes during your stay, you will probably find the sink space cramped. \nThe outside smell was very occasional during my stay in a rainy summer (I think it was related to the weather). When I noticed the weird smell, I just needed to close the windows to shut it out. The AC works very well. So, it was not a big deal for me to do so. \nOverall, I am happy with the values and qualities I got here, and I would highly recommend this place to anybody who wants to enjoy the city activities and have good rests in the same time.",

Titi was prompt to reply to my queries when booking the place and also remained available throughout my stay. Titi had left some space in the drawers so I could unpack and I had the fridge to put my week's supplies. It felt very homely. Wifi also worked very well.

Her place was inviting, bright and cozy. Everything was clean, parking tended to be pretty easy (although confusing in Montreal!), and the kitchen was stocked enough for us to cook up quick meals.

The house is beautiful, the surrounding front and back outdoor area is very spacious, interior is tastefully decorated, and the ocean is just yards away.

The location is central to driving to Kihei, Lahaina, Paia or Kahalui. One of the best places my family has stayed.  There are charming ducks and chickens roaming around on the property - the only slight downside was the great amount of duck poop on the porch every morning but it was an easy cleanup with the outside hose.

Property itself looks even better than in the pictures and it is quite large. House is very nice and you will probably find everything you need even though if you plan to cook every day you might be somewhat limited. Biggest problem we encountered is something that looked cool at the beginning - ducks walking around the property. They would constantly poop at the front deck and the deck would quickly become disgusting and unusable. Even if you wash it out with the hose, it will take them no time to make the mess again. However, somehow they decided to leave the back (ocean side) deck alone so we were able to truly enjoy the beautiful view.  I would recommend the place to couples or families with older children - not babies or small kids as the bedrooms are awkwardly placed (one is right at the entrance door) so you have to walk through the whole house to get to second bedroom. The host vas very helpful and responded quickly to all our questions.\n",

The bed were so cozy and bathrooms were pristine. This is one of the best and most accurate Airbnb ever and I highly recommend staying here. \nTo put a little icing on the cake communication with our host was prompt and very helpful they really want your stay to be the best possible!",

The ducks and chickens were a fun addition to the property (though they did poop all over the entryway). \n\nUnfortunately, there were some difficulties that were hard to overlook particularly at this price point. The general house cleanliness was quite poor.. floors were super dusty and needed a good mopping. Some of the kitchenware had crusty dust or rust on them. Other things were broken.. kitchen/scissors/blenders/glassware/kitchen gas downdraft. Also, only the living room ac worked, the bedrooms got rather hot. We really weren't expecting these issues at this price point hence the 3* review. \n\nThe house had a lot of geckos. We expected these outside or on the deck- but we spotted these just about everywhere you don't want to see one... in the bathroom, on our towels, on our clothes, on the chair, on the bed.",

The location is good- the town is meh (no good restaurants), but you are right in the middle of Kihei and Wailea- both are 15 minutes away.  The kitchen is perfect for cooking and is well stocked.  It says it has a hot tub and it does, but it is attached to the other unit on the property and we felt weird as their outdoor shower is right there.  I was concerned about the other unit on the property as we didn’t rent it, but we never saw anyone (just their car)- and it is a huge property so you don’t even realize it is there.  \n\nHonestly if you are looking for a beautiful home right on the water- this place is more than perfect.",

All the main touristic spots are literally walking distance (Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, Sydney Town Hall, main shopping centres). When we needed to use the train, Wynyard Station was just a couple of blocks away. Savings time and money with this prime location was definitely a bonus.\nThe flat feels bigger than in the pictures. The building feels old but once you get inside the flat everything is well kept. The main bed and the sofa bed were comfy and with white crisp linens. Had plenty bath and face towels. Did not find a problem with the hot water pressure as previously stated (might have been fixed). There are washing and drying machines in perfect working condition. The bedroom has a ceiling fan that was enough to sleep, there were a couple of pretty hot nights outside but we only needed to turn on the aircon for a couple of hours and the entire flat would cool off. The kitchen has everything needed to prepare all meals.\nDealing with the host was also a pleasant experience. All the information requested was given in a straightforward manner without delay. \nOverall, a great experience! Highly recommended",

There's even a Korean resto! (Seng Seng)\n4) Strong water supply with instant hot water\n5) Comfy beds and pillows\n6) Well-equipped kitchen with a complete set of glassware\n7) Umbrellas. It was raining on our 2nd day and the umbrellas came in handy.\n\nRoom for improvement:\n1) Directions on how to get to the meeting place e.g. which exit to take from MTR exit as there were lots of exits\n2) Standardised ON/OFF light switches\n3) Working clock in at least one of the rooms, if not all\n\nThanks again Jessa and Kris!

Her apartment is in a good location, only a 10-minute walk from Lesseps Metro Station.  The Gaudi Guell Park is an uphill walk of about 900 meters.  Our room and bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable for our family of three.  The internet worked well and her rooftop terrace was pleasant for afternoon tea and breakfast.  In fact, Nuria offered us tea on the roof upon our arrival.  We enjoyed having use of the kitchen during our stay.  The elevator in her building was nice for carrying luggage up and down.  Our Spanish and Nuria’s English were minimal, but we were able to communicate.  This is certainly not a luxurious place, but good for those traveling within a budget.   ",

Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until 10pm, but I was able to notify her through (Hidden by Airbnb) just before we took off and she was fine about it. She  has a small VW Pollo which we just managed to fit all 3 of our big bags in to, plus us 3 and Nuria! She pointed out the closest metro station (Lesseps) on the way to her house and made us tea on the Terrace upon arrival to her home. She doesn't speak English so we communicated in Spanish. The room was fine for us, a very narrow apartment, as are most apartments in Barcelona. A small lift was good to take our luggage up as the apartment is the top of 6 or so levels. We had a fan in our room and a big open window which was great as it was hot! Shower is either hot or cold and bathroom shared with another guest room. Towels provided. Showers between 7:00 and 22:00 as bathroom is inbetween the 2 guest rooms and that rule is to help keep noise levels to a minimum for any guests who might prefer to sleep from 10pm. Approx 15 mins walk to Park Guell which was great! And about 25 mins walk to La Sagrada Familia. A really great fruit/vegetable/organic produce with the best of everything just a few streets away. Access to fridge available on request. Access to cutlery, crockery and microwave (not oven or stove). Great strong wifi connection. A few barking dogs in the neighborhood, but otherwise quiet. Nuria kindly offered for us to leave our luggage for the day as we were checking out, but we didn't need to. Nuria seemed to do a bit of work from home, she kept out of our way, but was around if we had needed to ask her anything. Over all our stay was good. Muchas Gracias Nuria!",

The thing is that you won't want to spend that much time there because the neighborhood is amazing--which was also accurately advertised. We walked or took the metro everywhere and never used our car (we lucked out and found a parking spot right after the street had been cleaned and all the other cars had to move). There are so many great restaurants, cafes and boutiques nearby, and also a sweet park right at the top of the street. We walked to Mont Royal (and then walked to the top for an amazing view), and walked to the Metro stop to get to downtown (for free concerts at the Jazz Festival), the old port, and the Jean Talon market. Also, Libby was very helpful and available via email (and if my phone worked, I assume text as well); has lots of maps and brochures in the apartment for you to look at and use; and her housecleaner, who met us and gave us the keys, was lovely and full of tips about the city.

The kitchen is very small but it's well set out so there is still plenty of bench space. Being on a high floor the hot water doesn't run for particularly long but it's fine if you leave a bit of time between showers. Checking in and out was super easy! The building is in a wonderful location, we walked easily to Haymarket, Darling Harbour, the Rocks, and Circular Quay. TIP: If you are driving into the city, this is not the place to stay. Parking was a nightmare. Jared does warn that parking is expensive (he mentions $69 in the apartment description) but what I didn't realise is it's not just a $69 flat rate for more than three hours, it's $69 the first day, $50 overnight, then $69 for the next day. In the end we just gave up trying to find cheaper parking and paid. Other than that our stay was wonderful. Thank you Jared for being a wonderful host! ",

        "txt": "Margarida es una persona atenta y siempre dispuesta a ayudar; Oporto una ciudad hermosa llena de rincones en los que perderse. Lamentablemente, es difícil llevarse una imagen positiva después de que te roben. El día antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que había de valor, sustraído. Es una práctica habitual, no fue una excepción. La consiguiente desesperación, al estar \"abandonados\" en otro país, sólo la conoce quien la padece. Además, no habíamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \nLo verdaderamente problemático no es el robo en sí, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el teléfono, etcétera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que actúan desde el rencor.\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo será más seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\nEs recomendable también, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcionó el primer día, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \nPor otro lado, es difícil llegar a entender para un español (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se reúna gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la mañana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, teníamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy difícil dormir, pues la gente no tenía ninguna consideración ni civismo en este aspecto.\nEsto no pretende ser una crítica destructiva; quizá tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relación calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos señalados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo será bueno.",

As others also mentioned, it's a very basic 70s apartment (which in Portugal means - no central heating, and it can get a little chilly in there in winter even though there are electrical heaters), but the neighbourhood is calm and safe, shops are near, as well as the metro station, for me the WiFi was working all the time (sometimes a little slow, but it worked). Also the wooden floor is nice, and the kitchen is small but modern and has all you need to prepare small meals.\nCommunication and check-in was very professional. The flat was super clean. I'd come back when I'm coming to Porto again! ",

My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay in Willy's apartment and we wish we could return.\r\n\r\nWe booked this place almost last minute as I had to move to New York to start a job and look at apartments. We're glad we went with this one. It is half a block away from the R and only a few blocks from basically every other subway line worth having in Brooklyn. We could be in Manhattan in a minute's notice. \r\n\r\nIt is only a few blocks away from Montague St, the short shopping street in the middle of Brooklyn Heights, and a little farther away from Court St, the main shopping street this side of the Gowanus Canal. In short, the location is ideal. Don't pass this place up.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is spacious and light. The main room/bed room has two windows on three of its four walls and is constantly filled with light. The girl who lives there is a photographer, and it is obvious that she cares about the quality of the light in the room. To top it off, the apartment is appropriately accented with a few mirrors, which brightens the space even more. The bed, with its foam and vinyl mattress, is an absolute pleasure to sleep on. \r\n\r\nThose who come to New York fearing about grime and pests need not be afraid of this apartment. It is kept immaculately clean, and we stayed there ten days without seeing even a single fly. \r\n\r\nSheets and towels are provided, as well as a mostly empty closet and lots of reading material. The internet in the apartment has its ups and downs, but is mostly and unfortunately fairly slow.\r\n\r\nAgain, you would be a fool to pass this place up, especially at this price. ",

It was very close to several subway lines and shops, not to mention the river, from which there is such a beautiful view.  \r\n\r\nSecond, the apartment is a lovely alternative to getting a hotel.  While there were a couple of quirks, they weren't substantial in any way and the price was more than 50% less than nearby hotels.  The lighting in the place is stunning and the building tends to be very quiet.  Getting the keys was not a problem.  We had a bit of trouble getting in to the building a couple of times, but that was resolved with the help of a friendly neighbor who was our designated contact since the host is away.  The door to the apartment was a difficult to unlock as well, but that may have been my error.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would very highly recommend staying at Willy's place.  It's comfortable, inexpensive, especially compared to other nearby options, and charming.  We would like to come back soon!",

I call it hideaway because the apt. faces the back of the building and you hear nothing except birds chirping, no street noise. The apartment is very small: essentially the large, airy and lovely bedroom you see in the photo and then a tiny kitchen and bathroom. But it is the perfect setup and the PERFECT location if you want to be in the heart of Brooklyn Heights. There is a desk in the bedroom and an Internet connection (not perfect, but mostly worked) so I was able to get some work done too.  Willy was delightful to interact with - accommodating and prompt. After exchanging mobile numbers, we were able to text back and forth, which is very efficient. The bathroom sink turned out to be completely clogged but Willy got a plumber to fix it the next day. She met the plumber there and dealt with the situation, so it was no trouble at all for us. Definitely recommend.",

The complex is absolutely stunning with beautiful well maintained grounds and the pool area and views were absolutely gorgeous. The apartment was clean, well equipped and comfortable.  The only downside was that the bedroom is near the front of the unit and the traffic noise was quite loud, making it difficult to fall asleep. This is probably due to the fact the one of the window fixture in the bedroom is an open blind, offering great air flow but not much in noise reduction. However, this probably wouldn't bother a heavy sleeper or could be easily be minisimed with earplugs. On the whole we would definitely recommend!  ",

The views of the ocean were amazing, the resort is well kept and the landscaping is beautiful. Turtles were in the ocean at the edge of the property every morning, and we were usually able to scurry down with coffee or a mimosa and watch them swim and come up for air. The pool was rarely, if ever, used during our stay, so you could have it all to yourself. The BBQ are was clean and well-kept. This condo is on the third floor with stairs up, so if you have physical limitations it might be a struggle. However, the third floor placement allows for extremely quieter accommodations and an unparrelleled view of the ocean. The bedroom is on the street side, so road noise does creep in during the evenings. We easily slept and the noise didn't bother us at all. The fans and open windows kept us cool during the evenings with no need for AC (this unit does not have it). Although we didn't meet Ken in person, he provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy the condo without worry. This place is well stocked, clean and convenient. Highly recommended.",

That alone would have made staying here worth it, but on top of that, Keneke has stocked the condo chock-full of kitchen supplies and extra beach towels. Two advisories: the condo is on the small side for more than two people, although it can technically sleep four (two in the real bed and two on the pullout couch), and careful with parking here because other guests and owners can get a bit possessive, especially if they have large cars. Also, you definitely should have a car if you stay here because while a few markets/delis and shops are walkable, the town of Lahaina is not. I heartily recommend this wonderful clean condo!",

The area arround the apartment is just perfect to explore barcelona. There is a grocery store just arround the corner with very helpful employees and you can walk within 15 minutes into the center of the city.

When something needed fixing, he was there immediately with his handyman, who is also very sweet and helpful. The apartment is just like in the photos, though it is hard to capture how awesome it is to sit on the terrace and watch the birds and (on some nights) fireworks in the sky.\n\nThe air conditioning is in two rooms, the living/dining room and the master bedroom. This was plenty for the time we were there, but I bet it gets hot in August in the smallest bedroom. The kitchen could use a few more plates and utensils, as a family of four ended up doing lots of dishes, but that is minor.\nThe neighborhood is quite nice, shops and restaurants and groceries everywhere. The buses, tram, and taxis are at most a couple of blocks away, and the subway an extra block in the other direction. Very convenient and perfect for families. \nThank you Manuel for a marvelous stay!",

        "txt": "We wanted a cheap trip to Barcelona and my sister recommended we use airbnb. As it was our first airbnb experience we were a bit nervous, however it turned out to be a dream holiday. \r\nWe arrived at the flat and were met by Lola (the building guard) who gave us the keys and showed us around the apartment. It was perfect. Clean and tastefully decorated with all the kitchen appliances you could need! \r\nWe chose the apartment for the balcony and views and were blown away. You can see the whole of Barcelona from the balcony, all the way to the sea. Perfect for a sunny evening with a bottle of wine! The best thing about the balcony is that you are not overlooked by anyone. It is completely private and being so high up you are not disturbed by the noise of the road. \r\nThe flat itself is about a 10 minute walk from the metro station Guinardo and it's only a couple of minutes on the metro into town. The metro shuts around midnight so a few late nights we treated ourselves to a taxi back which cost about $11.\r\nLots of little supermarkets nearby to stock up and also several nice bars and cafes if you dont fancy the journey into town. \r\nAll in all was a perfect trip. Fantastic apartment which was great value for money. Would 100% recommend Enriques apartment and will certainly be staying again in the future.  ",

The reason I came back is because besides marvelous view and the setup the place has this amazing energy which is especially rejuvenating after a stressful work period back in NYC. Wherever you are in the apartment your eyes are almost constantly facing the green if the trees, water and the Christo statue in the background which is very relaxing. \n\nDuring my starving was around 35C in Rio so I spend a good time in the pool which is very deep, clean and enjoyable. Tivesse so good I barely went to the gym which is literally minutes away. \n\nCesar was super kind, he is definitely not your regular Airbnb host. As he knows I like to cook potatoes he showed me how to cook Mandioca Brazilian potatoes with shrimps. It was an unforgettable cooking and gastronomic experience. \n\nI will certainly come back again next time I am in Ipanema. ",

That made the trip a lot more relaxing. \r\n\r\nIf you plan to do more cooking, the kitchen could need a bit more equipment and we could for example only find 2 wine glasses and a limited number of kitchen utensils, but we nevertheless managed. \r\n\r\nAll in all we really enjoyed our stay and we recommend Patricia as a great host. \r\n\r\nBest, Thomas, Mette and Theodor.

And we realized that it was quite difficult to find such place in Barcelona.  But Patricia's apartment was exactly what we were looking for.  It's located in Gracia disctrict which is 5 minutes walk from Passage de Gracia (one of the main streets of Barcelona which brings you to the Cataloniya square).  But at the same time it's a district where local people leave and it has a charm old Barcelona - historical buildings, nice cosy squares full of life, plenty of food shops and even market with fresh sea food, vegetables and Spanish specialities.  This is exactly the place where you can feel the real, not turistic Barcelona.  We felt very comfortable and safe there.  The apartment is simple but has everything you need - 2 big comfortable bads, kitchen with oven, microwave and all the necessary utensils.  There is also washing machine but we did not use it.  In one of sleeping rooms there is a small cosy balcony where you can enjoy your glass of wine or breakfest.  Due to the fact that both sleeping-rooms windows looks to the patio, it's absolutely quiet at night.  And you can only hear a sound of old clock which goes from the clocktower on the neighboring square which is the main square of Gracia district.  That gives you a wonderfull feeling of being in another century.  So, we got all we have expected and even more:).  And Patricia was also great as host.  We had only one problem with wi-fi in the first day which she fixed immediately that day.  It was very easy and comfortable for us to communicate with Patricia.  So, we would recommend her appartment to those who want to enjoy real Barcelona in a comfortable and quiet way:). ",

Isabel was a gracious host who kept in good communication.  There was a small issue with check-in (the concierge was late to drop off our keys) and if you are a light sleeper you may want to bring earplugs as noise from the upstairs neighbours tended to reverberate through the floorboards.  Overall, it was an excellent base for our short stay in Porto (far more authentic and beautiful than a hotel room) and we would be happy to return. Thank you.",

It is near all the major sites and a 15 minute walk to The Riberia with restaurants, boat trips and Port caves. \nThe only suggestion would be for the concierge management, in that we were booked for a 15:30 check- in and were left waiting outside until 16:20 on the footpath/sidewalk until Louisa from the management company arrived, I understand traffic can be a problem, but would have appreciated a text or phone call as to the delay. I had to message the management service to find out any information and was only told someone was on the way - but no time indication.\nWe asked where would we find a grocery store and again Louisa did not have this information, nor recommendations. \nThe door to the apartment jammed and she could not get it opened, luckily my husband was able to 'pound' on the door to help us get in. When we tested the door to get out of the apartment again, she was unable to open the door. If my husband had not been with me, I or any women would not be able to get in or out of the apartment. Louisa said she would report this problem and hopefully, it will be resolved before the next people arrive. \nI would recommend this apartment when visiting Porto for location, and general facilities in the apartment.

Shopping and tasty gelato (our kids were staunch advocates for the Messina Gelato) were only a slight stone's throw further away on Hall St. \r\n\r\nHaving coffee available in the morning was a particular treat (thank you again, Cat), and there were ample cookbooks to review if we had had the time to really use the kitchen. Communications with Cat were easy for checking in and out; we didn't need to trouble her during our visit because the replacement light bulbs were easy to find when one fixture burnt out. We would definitely consider staying here again. ",

The bedroom is nice and clean and backyard is awesome. We had a great supper time with A&D in their backyard and we made BBQ! The apartment is located near the water and park is beautiful. The area is quiet and neighborhood is pretty nice. It's 10 mins away from Metro(subway) by feet and we didn't have any hard time traveling around downtown by taking the train.

We had gone into the city not really knowing what to do, and Denis sat with us for a good 15 minutes describing in detail some of his favorite places and the best times to go. Both Alexia and Denis were fluent in English and French, and we would engage in lively discussions on anything from politics to vegetarian recipes to Mario Kart (be warned: Alexia is prepared to defend her championship title on the last one!) On the flip side, they are also perfectly fine giving you space whenever you wish to rest or simply avoid social interaction.\nAs for the listing itself, parking was readily available on the street and the location was an easy 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station. Bathroom and bedrooms were clean, and the wifi connection was good. The apartment is in a quiet residential neighborhood with no traffic noise, and there are no pets in case any guests might have allergies. I will definitely be recommending this listing to any friends or family visiting Montreal!",

They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \n\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. ",

She responded to everything and does actually live close by (a good thing too, because the door code wasn't working when we arrived, but it was quickly addressed).  She was also helpful in giving us a bit of extra time for check-out.\n\nJust to say a couple things about the actual condo, the pictures do portray it in the best possible light.  Nothing deceptive, but there are elements that could use updating that are not shown.  The bathrooms need some TLC and there are lots of wires and cords everywhere (especially the bedrooms).  Everything else was clean and safe.  The kitchen is up-to-date with every appliance you should need, including a blender and toaster.  There is a newer washer and dryer right in the unit, which is very convenient.  We didn't use the TVs, but there are 3 of them - one in the main living room and one in each bedroom.  Parking was very convenient - a reserved spot that's just steps away from the ground level entrance (the condo is on the ground level and doesn't have any stairs).  There are several beach accessories waiting as well - a cooler, beach chairs and boogie boards are there for your use, along with plenty of beach towels.  There are 3 AC units and all of them worked, but they are noisy.\n\nThe noise level outside was generally good.  There were a few inconsiderate very early morning departures from other units, but nothing major.  The park across the road closes at 8pm, so there was no late-night noise to speak of.\n\nThe location in general is great.  The park across the road is not a swimming beach (no sand, too many rocks), but it's very popular for surfing and paddleboarding lessons.  There are several sandy beaches just a short drive (or healthy walk) away.  Kihei in general is a great spot to stay, as it's near several  great beaches (Big Beach in Makena is epic) and is central to a lot of things you'll want to see - the upscale Wailea area is just a short drive away and several other destinations are easily driveable from Kihei.  There are lots of food choices close by and many of them offer some of the best value you'll find in Maui.  There's also 2 supermarkets right down the road (and Foodland is open until 1am).\n\nTo summarize, the condo was more \"rustic\" than we were expecting, but I will say that in the area, you'd likely have to pay a bit more for something more updated that has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.",

Haleakala or the Road to Hana. Safeway is a short ~5 min. drive & Costco & the airport are a ~30 minute drive away. Her place has everything you need: kitchen, washer/dryer, beach towels/chairs, nice outdoor patio with a nice, small pool. I highly recommend her place if you want a quiet, quaint, peaceful place to relax where everything you need is a short distance away.

It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!

We especially appreciated the study nook and ability to use our laptop with wifi access and the well equipped kitchen for easy prep for meals (and deli close by makes it so easy to stock up).  The lounge, bedroom and bathroom are all in good, comfortable condition.  The little balconies and view of the courtyard topped it off.  A great experience and thoroughly recommend.",

There are so many details -- from the art on the walls to the spices in the kitchen -- that make it feel like a home away from home. The apartment is small but imminently comfortable with high ceilings and patios that make it feel spacious. The unit is off the street (on a courtyard)  so it was very quiet (that  and the comfortable bed made for great nights of sleeping). It's a beautiful street, just off Central Park and just around the corner from the subway. There are abundant restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the best coffee in NY (Joe's) is only about two blocks away. Chas was a great host who was quick to answer all our questions and make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We had our two sons with us (ages 10 and 12) and the living arrangements were ideal for a family our size. Thanks, Chas!",

Also, keep in mind that the beds in the loft may provide a bit of a problem for some guests - definitely best for kids. \r\nOverall, we had a great time at Chas' apartment and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to visit New York!

It’s large, filled with sunlight in the day and extremely comfortable. Sophie has decorated it tastefully and with a lot of thought, providing a lovely selection of art and deign oriented coffee table books for you to peruse. \r\n\r\nLocation wise it’s perfect, being a 5 min walk from the Sagrada Familia and there are a number of nice bars and restaurants in the direct vicinity of the apartment. It is also within easy reach of two central metro lines although we never once used public transport instead opting to rent bikes from a nearby rental shop (Barcelona is simply one of the best cities to ride in with you pretty much never having having to ride on the road ever!). In any case the main sites of the city are all within easy reach on foot. Its’s a 20 min walk to Place de Catalunya and Gothic Quarters and we very much enjoyed our gentle stroll’s home after a night of eating and drinking. \r\n \r\nSophie herself could not have been more accommodating. She’s was great to communicate with on the lead up to our stay and welcoming on our arrival. We didn’t want for anything on the trip at all. \r\n\r\nIf you book this apartment you will not be disappointed! ",

It has a big dinning room with a super cute balcony, sitting where you can have a cup of coffee and relax for reading. Two bedrooms and two individual bathrooms are quite decent for a family and two couples of friends to stay. \n\nAlex and Schwartz are very helpful to offer clear instructions and quick response whenever questions were sent. \n\nIt's impressive living experience and I highly recommend to all who gonna come to Barcelona for traveling.",

Как оказалось, мои волнения были напрасны: Али замечательный хозяин, подробно ответил на все мои вопросы, объяснил как добраться от аэропорта до квартиры, без проблем встретил меня в 02:00 (я прилетела поздно ночью). Моя комната оказалась маленькой, но уютной с красивым окошком, выходящим в небольшой зеленый сад. Что касается удобств, то здесь достаточно скромно, но есть все необходимое: хорошее соотношение цены и качества. Сама квартира находится в очень хорошем месте: это небольшая спокойная улица всего в 2 минутах ходьбы от улицы Истикляль, где расположено великое множество магазинов, кафе и ресторанов на любой вкус и кошелек. Рядом метро и остановки общественного транспорта. Также неподалеку находится Галатская башня, музеи, рыбный рынок, можно легко добраться до района Фатих (пешком через Галатский мост всего за 15-20 минут). Мои соседи оказались очень приветливыми, дружелюбными и позитивными ребятами, мне было легко и приятно общаться в ними, даже не смотря на мой ужаснейший английский)) Подводя итог, хочу сказать, что моя поездка удалась на все 500%, и выбор данного места сыграл немаловажную роль: здесь можно с головой окунуться в атмосферу удивительного Стамбула, забыть о том, что ты турист и просто наслаждаться этим великолепным городом.

There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \r\n\r\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!\r\n\r\n",

The apartment overlooks the main street which is full of nightlife and restaurants. With the windows open it could be a  bit noisy, but when they are closed it was very quiet so it was not an issue! Having the metro so close made traveling the city very easy. The biggest challenge was parking, if you plan to have a car your only decent overnight options require you to walk quite a bit. Check - in was very easy I would recommend this apartment for friends or couples looking to enjoy the Gay Village and downtown Montreal.",

Max $4/day for unlimited bus rides and no parking hassles what-so-ever!  (Read reviews for car rental at OGG and you'll find another great reason for going car-free! Not recommended, however, if you wish to do inner island sight-seeing such as Haleakala or Road to Hana.) There is parking under the building.\n\nSafeway is 2 blocks away and fabulous Baby Beach is a 10 minute walk. BTW, Baby Beach is spectacular. Easily the clearest water I've ever snorkeled in. Swim between circular coral outcroppings to see tropical fish and sea turtles. At low tide, wade out hundreds of yards and the water is not even waist high.  Kaanapali Beach - miles of sand, waves and tiki bars is just a half hour walk north or 12 minute bus ride. Easy to get to Black Rock for more superior snorkeling.\n\nComfortable Murphy bed in the living room lets you sleep to gentle breezes and the sound of the ocean. Nice (and very clean) pool area overlooking the ocean is the perfect spot to see sea turtles feeding at dawn and dusk. Very helpful manager on site who will take you out snorkeling, if you just ask.\n\nEvery appliance and amenity you need for a relaxing vacation.  Can't wait to go back!",

This part of Brooklyn is what New York is all about, a real mix, I would recommend it to anyone that is deciding between staying in  Manhattan or elsewhere outside the big apple. Jon has been very responsive throughout the period we secure the property. Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon). My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning.

It gives tips on how to navigate the city.\r\nThe apartment is clean and tidy, comfortable bed, clean sheets and towels.\r\nYou can freely enjoy the spacious kitchen to prepare meals.\r\nThe building has a lift and not have to carry luggage.\r\nThe apartment is located in an ideal spot. The main street of La Rambla (we go straight to the green metro line), you can walk in 5 minutes to the port of the same.\r\nTo Catalunya can be reached on foot in 10 minutes. Close to the charming Gothic Quarter.\r\nIf someone does not like the crowded La Rambla can enjoy a coffee and a bite to eat on the Rambla del Reval - out on the square right out of the apartment.\r\nIf I ever return to Barcelona it would definitely be with Aliona.\r\n\r\nAliona спасибо за замечательный отдых с вами.\r\nMałgorzata i Ewa\r\nМы надеемся, что вы посетите снова когда-нибудь в Барселону и остаться с тобой. большое спасибо",

Недалеко от метро (рядом метро и автобусы), пляжа, музеев, парков и вокзалов. Удобно что рядом находится много магазинов, ресторанчиков и рынок Бокерия. \n2) Квартира чистая, просторная, 2 удобные комнаты где помещается 3 человеческие (обгорелые после пляжа, напившиеся сангрии и наевшиеся хамона) особи. В каждой комнате вместительные шкафы, спасительный вентилятор и кровать. Просторная кухня где можно приготовить только что купленного на рынке тунца (креветки, мидии) и там же большой стол где поместятся все и всё. Обычный душ и туалет (совмещённый). Человек-сосед с дрелью не обнаружен, спали с открытыми окнами вполне спокойно, и шумели на улице какие-то строители за неделю только 1 раз. \n3) Кошки. Все любителям кошек сюда. 2 классных игручих создания приятно дополнять отдых. Если у вас сильная аллергия на кошек, то решайте сами. \n4) Хозяйка. Алёна – отличный человек с которым за неделю очень сдружились. Дала много полезных советов о Барселоне. Приятный собеседник. \nЕсли (когда) поедем ещё раз, обязательно вернёмся в эту квартиру. \nМинусы. \n- Дверь в туалет не закрывается на ключ. Решается тем что стучишься прежде чем войти. \n- Нет кондиционера. Но за эти деньги есть только вентилятор и губозакатывающее устройство. \nИтого: Снимайте отличная квартира по соотношению цена качество. 10 Елен Летучих из 10.",

With on site parking, a laundry, the most comfortable bedding I have ever slept in, an amazingly sunlight filled kitchen and in one of Sydney cutest suburbs this place was perfect for anyone wanting to visit Sydney! Close to shops, cafés and restaurants and only minutes drive from the cbd staying here was one of the best decisions I have made when visiting Sydney! Louise is wonderful and caters to your every need and is easy to contact! I highly recommend staying here to anyone who is wanting to visit Sydney for any period of time!! :) ",

My colleague and I stayed there for two nights whilst on business and it was so much nicer that the normal corporate apartment - but still had all the small touches you expect (bath robes, toiletries, hair dryer, etc...). It would also be a perfect place to stay for a pleasure. The location is great - right in the Woollahra village - and close to the city. Louise has exquisite taste and the apartment is decorated with a lot of style and panache.  She was an excellent host who communicated with me swiftly and effectively - our check-in was completely hassle free - and we were welcomed with fresh bread, fruit, and milk. We will definitely look to stay here again and highly recommend it to the airbnb community. ",

Before I started with the inside of the apartment, like any property the most important is location, location and location. Evan & Maria's apartment is located at the heart of Manhattan. It is a walking distance to the Rockefeller Plaza and also to Times Square. There are several restaurants near the apartment and a deli just around the corner to get anything you wanted. \n\nOkay, now we begin with the apartment. It is very beautiful. Not only you can get anything you wanted but also you can tell the owner put a lot of their heart in to it. It is beautifully decorated and also very clean. \n\nOn a personal note, we have the booking wrong, so we have to checked out a day earlier than we intended to. Evan and Maria were very nice and courteous about it. He texted us to let us know that we have to check out and patiently await our arrival, since we're on a ferry to Liberty Island, and help us find a hotel to move.\n\nAll and all it was a great experience even with the moving around and one thing for sure, if I ever in NY I will most definitely try to book Even and Maria super homey apartment.\n\nThank you Evan & Maria and good luck with the baby ...\n\nyours truly,\n\nThe De Haans",

The apartment is just as it appears in the photos: impeccably clean, modern, updated and cozy.  The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and provided a restful nights sleep after long days exploring the city.  Our adult daughter slept on the futon, and she was in heaven!  There were extra pillows, sheets and a comforter in the closet, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that she was more comfortable here than in the hotel room we stayed at during our first half of our trip.  The apartment had everything we needed: dishes, Keurig coffee and coffee maker (my #1 priority!), iron, hair dryer and much, much more!  There was a fantastic bottle of Pinot Noir that I thoroughly enjoyed and a jar full of Hershey's kisses (which we ate entirely too many of)!  Evan and Maria thought of everything; there is even an iPhone charger to use!  For NYC, it was very quiet and peaceful, which came as a pleasant and unexpected surprise to us.  The location can't be beat, close to great restaurants, parks,  & subways.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but let me end by saying that this apartment is so great that I want to live in it!  In fact, our daughter hopes to relocate to the city soon, and she took note of just how well Evan and Maria utilized the space and all the most wonderful details.  Well done.  Bravo!!!",

Be forewarned that since it's in the middle of downtown, it's not going to be quiet.This is no fault to the hostess, just that this city rarely sleeps - which, depending on who you are is a blessing or annoyance. Laundry is 10 blocks away since the hostess isn't in town, the sheets may not be clean so you'll have to do them yourself. Maria is always available via text so very helpful. If you drive, underground parking is a block away. Rental bikes are also close by. I would definitely stay there again for a quick weekend visit to Montreal.",

This was my first time using an airbnb apartment and I enjoyed feeling I was \"at home\" rather than at a hotel. I also really liked the neighbourhood. I felt that I was living among the locals and enjoyed picking up coffee in the local pastry shops. Although the apartment is located pretty close to the Sagrada Familia, I didn't feel I was in a touristy area. The apartment is very close to a couple of metro lines, and we used the metro a lot.

A beautiful property with lush vegetation and fruit trees of many kinds which you can partake of. Just down the road is a path that has an absolutely stunning view of the Maui coast with a path to a beautiful rocky beach. The house is comfortable and cool and is a great place to relax and rest after exploration. Every amenity you could want or need is there for you. We enjoyed the barbecue very much and loved that we had the washer and dryer. In short I will attempt to stay here any time I visit Maui this place is an outstanding value. Lastly Kandi is a very responsive host and obviously wants her guests to be impressed, we were, thanks a bunch.",

We didn't have time for your francesinha challenge Cátia but we'll take it up next time! The flat is in an excellent location; easy walking distance from attractions, but also in an area of great local bars and shops. Many happy times watching the world go by, and the football, at Cafe Java. And of course the roof top terrace is an excellent place to relax and enjoy wine, or beer, after a day of exploring the steep streets and many steps of Porto. We will most definitely be returning.

We only went up the north west side of maui for our luau and parasailing, which the drive is kinda far for that, but not too bad to do twice. Loved the we were able to use the beach chairs and umbrella, THEY ARE A MUST on a sunny day at the beach!!! Only draw back, which is common, was no air conditioning, but we knew that going into it!",

Her place is charming, but lacks air conditioning.  I'm from the Central Valley of CA & know heat, but the place is too hot to be in from 12-5pm, even with the drapes closed & the fans on high.  This meant we often could not eat lunch at the apartment & had to eat in town or take something in the morning when we left.\r\n  The upstairs neighbor also has a loud, aggressive, barking dog that we could hear most evenings.  The neighbor also chooses to brush her dog on the balcony, letting the dog hair fall onto Marilyn's patio below, even when we are sitting outside.\r\n  The final reason, most evenings we would return to the smell of pot from neighbors.  Some may not mind this, but it bothers me.  \r\n  I know most of these are not within Marilyn's control, but they did make our stay less than desirable. As mentioned, she was a pleasant host & quickly responded to any questions we had & made us feel welcome in her home.\r\n",

Just steps from the condo and never over crowded. The little town just down the road has great restaurants and shops to grab some Souvenirs. We would definitely suggest checking out the Paia fish market for lunch/dinner. You can't go wrong grabbing breakfast at the Kihei Cafe. Make sure to get there early and bring cash!! That's all they accept. \nIf you head in the other direction towards Waliea-Makena you can go to Makena park. Big beach is located here. It's a beautiful beach. The waves get a little big though, so keep that in mind. \nMarilyn's condo had everything we needed. The view is beautiful. The complex is clean and very quiet. We never saw or heard another person the whole week we were there. It felt like we were the only couple in the complex. Our only concern at first was that there is no AC, but after one night, we quickly realized that it was not needed. Marilyn provides multiple fans and Maui gets very cool at night. With the fan and cool breeze, we slept great!! \nWe managed to get around most of the Island while we were in Maui. And honestly, we always found ourselves wanting to go right back to Kiehi! It's a\nVery relaxed and laid back community with not an overwhelming amount of touristy activity, which is exactly what we wanted. \nWe definitely will be back to Maui and would LOVE to stay at Marilyn's condo again!!!!

She had some last minute instructions that we were unprepared for (unlisted on her website) regarding guests/visitors.  She did, however, accommodate our request.\n3.

After that I headed back to Paris, thinking to settle down there. After some times I decided to change my life and landed in Porto. I have been living here since 2010.\r\nSince then, I did not manage to get back and got in love with Porto. The seagulls, the Douro and the amazing color of the sun set, will without a doubt, make you also fall in love with this beautiful city.\r\nMake sure that you check out the little guide! There is some nice place to visit!\r\n\r\n",

Ce fut très ennuyant et surtout très fatiguant. Autre petit bémol, si l'appartement est fait pour recevoir 6 personnes (3 lits 2 places), il est impossible de se réunir à 6 pour manger puisqu'il n'y a pas de table (à part une petite table en plastique pour 2 personnes).

        "txt": "Pros: Stephen was super responsive. I appreciate immensely that he contacted me several days before my arrival to arrange for key handover. The building is located in a very convenient spot -- eateries, transportation (7-min walk to closest MTR station, a few minutes away on foot from bus 5/5X that goes to Stanley Market or the 100-series buses on Wanchai Rd. that go to the Kowloon side using the tunnel and you'll arrive at Hunghom where you can take the MTR and trains to NWT and China; tramway, and lots of taxis). Despite the various problems re: cleanliness, Stephen was quick to arrange for his maid to show up more than once. And as other guests noted, hard to find a place so conveniently located at this price.\n\nCons: I would remove the \"newly\" word from the property's title of \"newly decorated apartment\". The cleaner obviously did a superficial job only--found dust and tissue bits below the bed and mouldy caulking around the bathroom sink. A working fridge was one of my must-have items, but was disappointed to find the fridge seal was extremely mouldy, including certain parts inside. I guess my biggest surprise is that this room is actually a room within an apartment which is subdivided into five rooms. There is no window as understood through other reviews and confirmation from Stephen, so won't be suitable for those who are claustrophobic, and you'll have to rely entirely on the air conditioning for fresh air. There is, however, a pseudo-window slot that is open to the corridor in the common area. Would have made the space much more homey if there were a small curtain covering this pseudo-window space since it is half-covered by a file folder and you can still see the dirty metal guard and the sheet of dirty plastic with a hole for the air cond. unit exhaust. I was much taken aback by this after seeing the more \"modern\" amenities, such as the cupboards and bathroom tiles. Another thing that bothered me was the absence of hooks for clothing, except for the three tiny adhesive hooks in the bathroom (but since the shower is in the same space as the toilet, one cannot use these tiny hooks for dry clothing anyways) and the bar on the glass door (but I didn't want to hang too much on it since the bar is against a glass door). Hence, the only chair in the space is hijacked by my clothes. So if you plan to stay there more than a week, you might find it inconvenient. \n\nAll in all, if you don't have a keen eye for cleanliness, you will like this place for its proximity to amenities and quick response from host.\n\nHint: If you arrive at the building by taxi, give the taxi driver the Wood Road address, but then you'll have to walk to the Heard Street entrance to enter the building since the security code doesn't work on the Wood Road entrance.",

There are also buses that take you in no time to down town Brooklyn and Williamsburg. Supermarket is around the corner. Bakery for great breakfasts and deliciuos donuts place at 2 minutes walk from home.\r\nThe back garden is also very nice, we were too busy walking all day long, but it gave us a sense of big space, on a nice day you could spend time outside and enjoy a private corner of open air.\r\nIf I have the chance to go to New York again, I will surely go back to Michelle!",

I am 180 cm (5' 11'') and fit on the couch and it was pretty comfortable.\r\nWhen we arrived Michelle's house she greeted us right away, took her time to explain how to commute, where to eat and what to do in the city. \r\nThe location of house is pretty good. It takes 20-30 min with metro to Manhattan downtown, depends on which line you use. You can also take the metro from JFK, otherwise the cab costs  around $50. In the house everything was clean and neat. She also provided us towels for shower etc. Besides that, whenever I texted to Michelle she responded in timely manner, which made everything easier.\r\nHonestly, our overall experience was much better than I expected.  Me and my family had a very good time in Michelle's house and NY. If one day I go back to NY, I know where I should stay. \r\n",

Her service is much better than anything you would get at a hotel for a much better price. She gave us a recommendation on where to get breakfast that turned out great. The place is very clean and neatly decorated. It's literally right off the subway station, so that's a huge plus. We also met her mother, who is a fascinating woman. I highly recommend her place, if you are looking to visit the area.  \r\n-- Later Edit:\r\nI should mention that her internet is very fast. I don't know what ISP she uses, but it was a joy to go back to a temporary accommodation and know that you are well connected while traveling. I'm not sure of the exact setup, but it appeared that we had a separate modem and router just for us. This was a huge relief. Michelle had the SSID and password printed and ready for guests, so even if you forget to ask, you would still find them in the apartment. Overall, things were very well thought out before hand and Michelle was very proactive with tiny details like this that make all the difference. This was very surprising to me knowing that I'm dealing with an individual and not a company.   ",

        "txt": "Nous rentrons d'un séjour de 8 jours à NYC où nous avons séjourn (Website hidden by Airbnb) Adultes et 2 ados) chez Michelle début mars. nous en sommes ravis malgré des températures froides.\r\n==)positifs: \r\nBon compromis rapport qualité / prix. La proximité avec une station de métro est un plus ainsi que celle de l'épicerie permettant de faire les petites courses pour les repas pris au gite. Michelle est extrêmement accueillante et serviable. \r\nl'appartement est simple et très propres. 4 vrai lits confortables. \r\n==)négatifs:\r\nbien que situé dans un quartier + calme, la chambre donne sur la rue, et les nuits peuvent être difficiles pour les oreilles sensibles. le métro qui passe dessous est audible, tout comme les avions. mais à New York , il est difficile de trouver une endroit très calme. NEW YORK reste un environnement urbain et donc globalement bruyant, autant en avoir conscience. \r\nPour une famille de 4, les lits enfants sont dans la pièce qui sert de coin jour. Une table et chaises pliantes nécessitent d'être pliés  pour installer le 4ième lit et inversement, plier le lit pour prendre les repas. Pour les français que nous sommes, la table est aussi importante que le lit. ça peut être un problème. \r\nPeu de vaisselle ( verres en plastique) ce qui est un peu dommage mais ça reste un détail.\r\nMais quand on vient à New York, ce n'est pas pour une ballade gastronomique. Nous recommandons vraiment cette adresse. Très bon compromis.\r\nLa cours arrière sera appréciable pour les périodes + douces.\r\n\r\nEnglish comments:\r\nJust returned from NYC where we stayed with our 2 teenagers in Michelle's appartement. We are really delighted .\r\n\r\n==)positives:\r\nGood compromise quality / price ratio . Proximity to a metro station is a must as well as with the grocery store allowing some errands for meals at the appartement. really practical, opened until 21h. Michelle is extremely friendly and helpful.\r\nthe appartment is simple but  very clean with 4 real comfortable beds.\r\n\r\n==)negatives:\r\nAlthough located in a quiet neighborhood, the parent room is overlooking the street, and the nights can be difficult for sensitive ears. Subway is audible,as well as cars & trucks in the street. But to moderate this aspect,  in New York, it's difficult to find a quiet place because it remains a generally noisy urban environment as knowledge.\r\nFor a family of 4, children beds are in the main room. A table and chairs need to be folded to open beds and vice versa, folding bed for meals. it could be a problem.\r\nVery few dishes ( plastic glasses ) which could be improved but it's still a detail.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to visit New York, it is not for gastronomic ballad, and it's important  to find a confortable & clean area. The backyard could be pleasant when the weather allows to use it. Unfortunatelly for us it's was too cold begining of march.\r\nWe really recommend this address.\r\nMany thanks to Michelle.\r\n\r\nPascale et Yann.",

The only thing we like to mention for the apartment that is located in a really nice area of Sydney, is that you can only reach it by bus (5 stops) - so there is no tram nearby. The last bus we were able to find to the direction of the apartment left the city at 8:30 pm. That was sometimes a little bit early for us and we had to take an uber (which costs around 20AUD). Everything else was really awesome and we can recommend to stay there for sure. Thank you Krythia for the amazing stay in Sydney.",

O bairro do Catete tem uma localização boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa à pé e também para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A estação de metrô também é perto e tem várias opções de alimentação muito próximas à casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se à um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferença com o calor que está no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que são suficientes para o número de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei lá, o banheiro não foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os hóspedes estavam mantendo-o em condições de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \r\nOutro ponto importante é que os quartos são ligados por uma porta que não tem fechadura e é bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade não é garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\r\nO preço é justo pelo que é oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se é possível fechar a comunicação dos quartos.",

Kenny was very quick to respond and helped us find an extra parking space for our U-Haul trailer which we had with us as we were moving our son into his apartment for the school year.  \r\n\r\nThe location is perfect, the apartment is large and I especially enjoyed sipping my coffee on the back balcony! Also, the free parking was fantastic for a small/regular sized vehicle. Parking may be too tight for a large SUV. The keyless entry was convenient, and the ac was welcome as it happened to be a hot and muggy couple of days.  Finally, we asked what we should do upon leaving and Kenny quickly wrote back \"don't do a thing\" and \"good luck\" to our son. It was a nice, personal touch.",

The rooms are spaced pretty far apart for privacy, which was an added bonus. The bathroom is large and the water pressure in the shower was excellent (it's a pet peeve of mine when pressure is low!).\r\n\r\nKenny was extremely responsive -- he answered a bunch of my emails before the trip and a couple I had while we were staying at the apartment, most of them nearly immediately. \r\n\r\nI would definitely stay here again!",

It's a big house with 10 large bedrooms, and common livingroom and large kitchen, deck (super nice) and bathrooms (3 bathroom area with individual shower (nice one), sink and toilet). I met nice people who gave me good advices to get around Sydney. David, the host, is very responsible and responded on the post to my emails while I was there. Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there. (details: bus are down the street, Sydney downtown is 25min away, the airport is 20 min away (35$ for a cab), Bondi beach is 2 beaches away :p (20min), and peroquees are all around:)",

Another plus is the proximity of an underground parking garage (15€/day, ask the attendant for coupons). \n\nWe were a family of 4 adults. We found the apartment very well equipped and very spacious. It was clean and everything was in good order. Showers were hot with plenty of pressure. There is a second WC and with 3 women in our group it's a bonus. \n\nCristina was a joy to communicate with and she answered all of our questions very rapidly. She was waiting for us when we got there with a smile even though we were late getting there. \n\nWe hope to return one day to Porto to experience it without the rain and we will be staying at Cristina's place again most certainly.\n\nThank you Cristina for welcoming us!",

She won't listen to me explain either, \"don't argue!\" That's what she said\r\n\r\nI didn't see her much during the days I stayed. She did provide me privacy and a big bed. Thanks.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen sink was always full of dirty dishes, I was not cooking there, just not so pleasant.

There is a cool breeze that will make you never want to leave! As for drive, it was less than an hour from Kahului Airport and the drive to several beaches were less than 10 minutes, I would highly recommend staying at Leila's!!

From the spacious living areas to the modern decor, Leila's condo is located in a prime spot with spectacular views of the Pacific Ccean. After staying at her place, I wanted to highlight 4 great things about our experience: \n\n1) Resort amenities- there is a complimentary shuttle that can take you between the Ritz Carlton and Montage resorts from your villa, along with other places in the Kapalua resort. This is great, especially for trying the top rated restaurants at the resorts without having to pay for parking...plus you can have a glass (or bottle) of wine and let someone else worry about the driving :) Or you can walk!\n\n2) Accessibility- Whether you are looking to take in a nice stroll along the beach or play a round of golf, her villa is nestled right in the heart of the Kapalua Resort. Even in the rain, you can enjoy the nice pool with a covered eating area! And I need to mention that the views from her condo are breath-taking, so if you fancy a night in, hers is the place to do it!\n\n3) Her Condo- I've stayed at hotels and resorts before, but I have to say that her villa exceeds anything you can find at a high end resorts. The wi-fi was strong and fast - able to be used among multiple devices. And the entire space was so clean! We had the security of knowing that the crew didn't just do a once over and be done, but actually took the time to make sure that it was ready and prepped for us, as if no one had stayed there before us. I'm a stickler for very nice bedrooms and beds, and hers was not only comfortable, but also offered me a great night's rest after a day of beach, beach and more beach :)\n\n4) Leila & Dan - They have been a gracious host, allowing us to stay at their condo. They were quick to respond, always providing us with best in class service, and were able to provide some great recommendations on activities and events to do on the island. \n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to read my review. Our experience staying at Leila and Dan's condo was great, and we truly enjoyed the time we spent on Maui. I cannot thank them enjoy for allowing us this great and special opportunity, and for giving us a chance to experience this beautiful island in a way that like no other. For this we are very grateful! \n\nWe wish you all the best in booking your stays through AirBnb and hope you have the opportunity to stay at Leila and Dan's condo... we hope to as well very soon! \n\nMahalo!",

The house is walking distance from a small beach, and is a quick drive to the Honolua General Store which has coffee, pastries, sandwiches and hot food, toiletries, towels, sunblock... pretty much everything. \n\nThe house comes equipped with travel size shampoo, body wash, hair conditioner, and bar soap. It also has a small hair dryer.\n\nThere are beach umbrellas and chairs in the backyard ready to be taken to the beach.\n\nThe wind gusts can get a little loud at times, I think because of how the house is situated on the hill. The bed was a little bit lumpy, but mostly soft and comfortable. The house renovations are gorgeous and look brand new, and there's a huge second bathroom with a great bathtub not pictured in the photos! Very clean, bright, and lovely. As other reviewers said, the photos do *not* do this house justice.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful place to stay. Thank you!",

The place is even better as shown on the picture. It is very clean and tastefully furnished. The kitchen has everything you need to cook. And all the bedrooms are very nice. You got even surfboards or bikes to use. We had every morning our breakfast on the porch which was always a very nice start into the day. From the house you will get in approx. 30“ to the ocean where you can enjoy every day the moast romantic sunsets. Its just fantastic. Puamana Ocean Breeze Bungalow is located close to Lahaina where you also find a lot of nice restaurants and grocery stores. And from Puamana you also can do realy nice daytrips like going snorkeling or do the road to Hana, to Wailea Makena or you go to Haleakala where you have a nice few on 10000 Feet over Maui (if the weather is nice) And if you just feel like relaxing than the ocean pool from Puamana is the perfect place just to calm down an enjoy the beauty of the pacific. Right in front of the club house are two surf spots where my son and daughter went surfing every morning. We just can highly recomand this beautiful place and we are still overwhelmed. Thank you so much Elise for having us. You have been always so nice and flexible and did respond very quick to our e-mails and answers. We had a realy great time and we will miss this quiet and romatic place. We just love Maui and all the other Hawaiian Islands. \nMahalo for everything. \n\nLajos and Family",

Check-in instructions very clear and easy.\n\nThe house has a lovely back deck, while although not entirely private as you can see the other neighboring decks, was a nice place to enjoy some meals.

If it's to party and enjoy the nearby festivities until the wee hours of the night then this is perfect for you. I have to say that this place was a little too loud for my taste. Loud music from neighbors late at night and the busy street wasn't all that fun for an early sleeper like myself dealing with jet lag but it's out of Gwen's control so I just put my earplugs in and hoped for the best.

There aren't many things to do in the area, but with the subway so close, it didn't really matter to us.\n\nAt first glance, the neighborhood appeared a little sketchy and run-down, but we never had an issue.

And you could even find a copy of Animal Farm on the shelf, LOL. This really is what airbnb should offer in the first place, not some small and smelly hostel rooms without a window.\n\nThe host: quick response, easy communication, friendly permanent roommate. \n\nTo summarize: awesome place, would definitely come back and also recommend to friends.\n\n\n\n在香港住过不下十家的Airbnb平价旅店里,Felipe是我目前的最佳选择｡地点便利,步行五至十分钟可达坚尼地城地铁站｡楼下就有7/11便利店(有免费wifi),数家粉面店､茶餐厅(120闷二人晚餐好超值),Watson､百佳､惠康超市｡Felipe的房间安静､干净,空调无味｡起居室有沙发很舒适,附带厨房､洗衣机､冰箱｡书架上还有动物农场和其他一些书,不知可不可以拿来看｡｡｡与房主沟通很好,回复很快｡永久室友(真*房东)也很友善｡总之,远远好过无窗劏房小旅馆｡强烈推荐｡",

With private access it leaves you free to enjoy the environs on your own terms. The beach is a stones through away. I would love to have stayed longer. It is a quiet refreshing space in which to contemplate. A ferry ride to Cronulla is available if one needs to re-quaint once self with urban life, with the addition of train to CBD if needed.

Oh and the artwork is awesome!\r\n\r\nThe garden is lovely too and it’s a short walk to the end of the street to the beach and the national park. The beach is GORGEOUS!! Crystal clear, calm water and pretty seashells. Its also nice and protected so you don’t get blown away or sandblasted which happens on some other beaches.  Just past the beach is a path to the national park, which is so pretty. There were lots of birds and trees and beautiful giant rocks and some Aboriginal carvings. \r\n\r\nIt bucketed rain most of the weekend we were there but we still had a lovely weekend.

Lots of ships coming and going to view.\nJoao makes every effort to make hosts comfortable and is very available for enquiries. We felt we were treated royally. \nThe apartment is well equipped for self catering and a well stocked larder.  Joao made some very good local restaurant (many in close proximity ) recommendations too. Major Supermarket other end of beach so handy to have bikes as transport. \nEverything made available from washing machine to bedding. Massive walk in wardrobe. Hot water reliable. \nHis knowledge of Porto and provision of maps and information including travel cards was very helpful. There is a bus stop very close which takes you into the city in about 40 minutes for only €1.85. Matosinhos is a 20 minute walk away where you can pick up Metro, visit a market or eat at the many fish restaurants (fresh from fish market adjacent).\nWe made good use of the bikes and this saved us time and expense also.\nWe took the brilliant cycle way (no hills!) along the coast for about 20 km (Vila do Conde and beyond). Beaches and cafes all the way so a great escape for the day.\nUnfortunate the lift not always working but we survived and our fitness improved. \nProbably true of all apartments of any height, you do get some road noise and barking/ howling from local dogs.\nHappy to return to what became home away from home for nearly 2 weeks.\nThankyou Joao for making it possible. \n",

There is a washer and a small kitchen upstairs that you can use, and it connects to a terrace. Kamuran welcomed us when we got there and showed us our room. She's usually in the travel agency office downstairs so you can reach her easily if you need anything and get some recommendations on what to do or where to go. Word of advice, don't use their airport transfer car because it's more expensive then just getting a taxi from the airport (taxis run about 50 TL to Sultanahmed and their car transfer is 20$ which is about 72 TL ). We also had to wait 30 minutes outside the airport for the driver to pick us up. ",

We have walked all over from here, the metro stop is also close. There is a small kitchen and laundry place on the roof, which was great. Also the view is beautiful. ONE small inconvenience would be the morning noises from the street, but that didn't keep us from having a great stay here.

The room was very clean we had everything ,even a shower gels and hairdryer, iron,washing machine,we could stuck over food in the fridge that was very useful. During our stay it was very hot in Istanbul so air-conditioning was a life saviour. For all the questions we had about where to go and how to get we got the most detailed explanation,me and my boyfriend couldn't imagine best host then that. All the problems you might possibly have with the room will be solved in a blink of an eye! Location was more then just great, Sultanahmet is the best district to have all the points of interest around you, Hagia Sofia 10min,Blue mosque 7 min ,tram station 8min,lots of place to eat around, only be weary Turkish people(sellers/restaurants) cheat the whole time ,don't order a beer in the restaurant without asking the price ,don't pick up a brush from the shoe cleaning man when he dropped it,in Istanbul is a lot of scam is going on!",

The apartment is also a short walk to the Besiktas ferry, which has wonderful views on the Bosphorus to other great districts in Istanbul. The apartment was sparkling clean and had so much style which I can imagine comes from Tugba's great sense of style as a designer. It also next door to a small convenient store that keeps late hours, and around the corner from a big supermarket. As a host Tugba was very understanding and responsive and pleasant.

The shower is excellent, which was also a big plus for me.  I would have liked to have air-conditioning, as it was very hot when I was in Istanbul.  There is a mobile ventilator which helps a lot, but sometimes it is not enough.  You have to be aware that there is no lift, so you will need to go up two flights of stairs which might be a problem for those who have trouble carrying heavy luggage. Tugba is very kind and attentive and is very quick in responding to any queries.   Recommended!   ",

He is very hospitable, sociable, always ready to answer any questions and give advice. \nThe house is very spacious and warm, with all necessary equipment, and the atmosphere is so that I felt like at home)  \nYou will need about 30-40 minutes to go to the centre of Istambul by bus, keep it in mind when you plan your trip.\nBut though it is a bit far from the centre, there are advantages too. The house is situated in the district for locals, not for tourists. So you can buy cheap food there. You can find locum for 6 lira/kilo, cheap nuts and other turkish delights. There are also local shops near the house with good quality cotton clothes, underwear, tights etc.\nDefinitely recommend this host! Thank you very much for your hospitality!",

We appreciated the convenience of the dishwasher and washer and dryer.  The grounds themselves are perfectly manicured and have many bbq grills which we used on several occasions.  The grounds are very clean and the bbq grills themselves are cleaned by the apartment complex's maintenance crew.  The grounds are right on the edge of a shore (not exactly a beach that one would go to for swimming and lounging) that provide stunning views of the water and sunset.\r\n\r\nThis apartment is a great value in that you are centrally located among different sights such as Wailea Beach and Lahaina (a 15-30 minute drive).  We would recommend renting a car so that you can drive around the island.  Very few sights would be easily accessible to you otherwise.  There are also a full bathroom for each bedroom, so you have a 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment.  The master bedroom has a lanai the provides a good view of the island.  The second bedroom's window looks out into the dark hallway of the apartment floor though.  A free parking spot was provided for the unit, which was convenient for our rental car.  There is also a balcony off of the kitchen that provides you with a great view of the water.\r\n\r\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this unit!",

The place is very clean, has a bunch of amenities, and also has some beach accessories. We came as a couple but we able to make a couple breakfast meals and just relax instead of always having to go to a restaurant. It is about 45 minutes from the airport but is only 20 minutes from the main town of Lahaina (which is great to walk around, shop, and eat) and 10 minutes from kanapali which has a lot of great restaurants and shopping.

Her condo is clean and fresh and perfect for anyone who really wants to experience authentic Maui living. Maria's home is located in a very private and tranquil area of the property.  I'm grateful the time we rented fell on my days off from work because I got to enjoy reading on the lanai, grilling dinner and night swimming in the evening at the common area pool (hubby and I do this anyway, but this felt like an actual getaway!).  Also, the breezes everyone talks about? They're amazing.  It's a special place.  I highly recommended.",

The condo had a couple little things that made it seem very \"lived in\" like a dirty bar of soap in the shower. The towels smelled a little musty. You must be VERY quiet as it was only two of us there, going to bed by 9:30 PM and still got a note on our car. It read \"we can hear you walking heel tow down the stairs\". Basically tiptoe around because the walls are very thin. Overall affordable spot, good communication and Napili is great. ",

It looks like the pictures and was very quiet, though nearby to restaurants and shopping in the downtown area as well as Mont Royal. The kitchen had all the standard amenities. They provided shampoo/soap/conditioner and towels as well. I would stay in this apartment again. There were only 2 of us but it is large enough to hold a couple more people (though only has 1 bathroom).\n\nTwo things to note: as stated in the description, the building is currently under construction. It was very loud for 2 days of the trip but we didn't hear it at all on the 3rd day. Keep that in mind if you choose to book while the construction continues. Second, Sonder requires you to register on their website (with name, email address, and phone number) in order to rent an apartment from them.",

The kitchen, dinning area, and living room have basic furniture that will work for most travelers. The beds are a little stiff but there are worse places to lay your head. The bedroom with the ball lamps on the side table is very bright while the other bedroom is wonderfully dark. Temperature control is challenging since the only AC unit is in the dining area. Water temp fluctuates without adjusting the nozzle/valve, but that's probably building-wide. During our stay there was construction on our balcony so we woke up each morning to those sounds. We were instructed not to open the windows to avoid dust coming in. On the morning of checkout the next client came in at 7 AM. That was awkward. In summary, it's a nice place but this wouldn't be my first choice for the next visit to MTL. ",

From this place you can visit most monuments in the European side of Istanbul with the least complications (bus stop 1 min away and it serves Sishane metro in 10 min). If you take the bus to Sishane you can have 1 hour walk to most historical places in the European part. Next to his place there is a big market (both sides of a long street) with lots of local Turkish food. Just before his place, you can identify a small restaurant and a small grocery store. \n\nAli is such a great host with distinguished Turkish hospitality. He helped me several times to locate appropriate places for buying gifts. We had interesting discussions and his excellent English helped us had rich cultural exchanges. \n\nI'd recommend this place if you want to get a great value of your money and enjoy a true Turkish life experience (neighborhood and hosting).",

        "txt": "This place is great. It's a small studio unit in a neighborhood/apartment complex like area. There is a washer dryer on property. It costs $1 to wash and about $1 to dry clothes. \r\n\r\nThe kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, and dishes. The fridge worked great. A short drive away from Napili Plaza that has a grocery store, coffee shop, a good taco place, and a pharmacy. Also there is a shop there that has snorkel gear for rent. You will need this to swim with the sea turtles. \r\n\r\nThe unit does not have air conditioning. I kept the sliding glass door open while I slept to keep the air circulating. Also the front door has a gate that you can lock while keeping the front door open. However some moths and the ocassional mosquito can get in. There is a screen on the sliding glass door in the back and a privacy shade that you can pull down. \r\n\r\nYou can walk to the Napili bay beach from the condo, about 10 mins, it's better than trying to find parking. There is a weird beeping noise right outside the bathroom window. You can hear it very clearly from the bed at night. This was distracting sometimes as I am a writer so it was hard to focus. I did most of my writing at the coffee shop which as described does have Wi-Fi and is very good. \r\n\r\nThere are two beach towels in the closet and a mini cooler for the beach. The condo unit is small, so there is no living space to hang out. But most of your day you will be out and about or at the beach all day. So you really only need this place for some cooking and sleeping. \r\n\r\nI did not use the TV. I turned it on once and couldn't figure out the cable so I didn't bother with it. The host is very helpful, just text if you need anything. \r\n\r\nThere is a specific parking spot. Use the parking decal provided and stay in that spot. The trash is located at the entrance to the property. I did not check out the pool area as the beach was amazing and took up all my time. Also 5 mins away from Spa Montage. If you get a day pass for $55 you can hang out at the spa all day between the pool, hot tubs, and hydrocircuit.  It was a fun way for me to kill half a day and read in the relaxation lounge. \r\n\r\nFrom Lahaina harbor you can get day trips on a ferry over to lanai or Molokai islands as well. I heard the snorkeling at Kaanapali was a little clearer, but I noticed the currents were much stronger there. I prefer Napili bay. Give the shower pull thing a jiggle if it doesn't make the water go all the way up.",

I was able to message and confirm booking with Debra all within an hour on a Saturday night which is amazing. THANK YOU DEBRA! \n\nThe apartment was very clean and had good add-ons for going to the beach (cooler, beach towels, snorkel mask). \n\nMy major feedback:\n\n1. The apartment gets hot at night unless you're comfortable sleeping with the sliding door glass open. Coming from my creepy situation, I did not feel comfortable sleeping with it open and there are not other windows in the sleeping/common area. Debra mentions something along these lines in her posting so take that seriously. \n\n2. You can hear your neighbors. One neighbor was up at 5am and it sounded like they were literally on my patio. The other neighbor upstairs had a young baby that I heard crying. The apartment is also under the stairs so you can hear people walking up/down the stairs when it's extra quiet at night. I'll admit that I was a little harder to please than usual -- I was more jumpy to noises since my space had been violated at the other accommodation. Also, you're in Maui. If you're up at 5am it's not the worst thing in the world. \n\n3) I paid $200/night total w/ fees and it felt slightly overpriced. Small things that made me feel that way -- no dish towels (I think?),  a rusty shower head + dingy shower curtain, no place to leave wet things (you're warned that you'll be fined if you leave clutter or beach gear on the patio or walk way) All that said, perspective! We're in Maui and $200 night was some of the cheapest accommodation I could find. It's all relative. \n\nOverall, the place was safe, clean, and convent to driving Route 30 south/north to the other towns beyond Napili. There's a grocery store and some great happy hours nearby. Really grateful I had a roof over my head, a comfy bed to collapse into and a door that locked. Thank you Debra. ",

Checking in was simple and we arrived to a lovely bottle of bubbles! The view and location are absolutely unbeatable, and the apartment is terrific. The photos do not do justice - it's an amazing apartment! Great lighting, very comfortable, and well furnished. The flat has all the amenities you need and truly makes you feel at home.  \r\n\r\nWe had a very small issue with the internet dropping out periodically but Kate went above and beyond to ensure things were fixed.  And… left us another bottle of bubbles for our troubles, which was so incredibly nice!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was a short walk to Bondi, Bronte and Coogee beaches.  The walk from Tamarama to Bondi is breathtaking.  We were lucky enough to catch the Sculptures by the Sea the week of our stay.\r\n\r\nOur experience was outstanding and highly recommend Wayne and Kate’s place. We did not want to leave! We look forward to staying at Wayne and Kate’s in the future. Thanks again for everything, Wayne and Kate!  :)\r\n",

All of the amenities are in great condition and all three of the bedrooms were large with the beds comfortable and extremely clean.\r\n\r\nAfter settling in and making a cup of tea and coffee with the stocked kitchen, we decided to take a look at the lengthy list of activities that Wayne and Kate had compiled just for us. You can never undervalue local knowledge!\r\n\r\nWhile Wayne and Kate’s place is extremely fun, it’s also the perfect place to get some work done. We popped down to Tamarama Beach Café (across the road!) and bought back some coffee and sat and worked at the breakfast bar overlooking Tamarama Beach with our laptops – using the speedy wifi that was provided, of course.\r\n\r\nSimply, Wayne and Kate are amazing hosts and their stunning apartment is perfect for work, play and everything in between!",

We took Ade up on some recommended places to eat and they were all great local places, well researched.\r\n\r\nIt was easy walking distance to all points of interest in Williamsburg, from the vintage market to the regular street food festival and East River Ferry, providing access to other parts of Brooklyn, downtown NYC and Governor's Island.  \r\n\r\nThe short walk to different subways meant getting into the city was very fast, particularly areas such as East Village and Park Slope.  We regularly went from the heart of the city back to the apartment within 20-30 minutes, a good escape when the crowds got too much in  Manhattan.\r\n\r\nAde welcomed in and helped us up with the bags on day 1.  There is no lift but compared to subways, a few flights of stairs was not a problem.  Again, on departure day she was very accommodating letting us leave the bags and helping us with getting them down again.",

Other than that, I highly recommend this place. Clean, comfortable, modernized, close to bus stops and subways, bike rental access across the street, not too far from downtown, and lots of restaurants and cafes in the area.",

Even though it's on street level, the street is a quiet / residential one, and the entrance is some distance from the sidewalk—so noise is not an issue. There are very nice restaurants and cafes less than a block or two away. Ildiko went the extra mile in stocking the apartment with essential items, including a fully stocked first-aid kit(!). Although I had office space in Manhattan, I spent all of my time working from home, because I didn't want to leave the house or this neighborhood. Prospect Park is also very close, which makes for a nice place to go for a walk and clear the mind. Definitely one of the nicest and most pleasant airbnb experiences I've had so far!",

En el soterrani, sense finestres, s'ubica la sala de màquines, canonades, un traster i un petit bany.\r\nA la penúltima nit hi va haver una inesperada fuita d'aigua al soterrani que Miriam i la seva família van resoldre molt ràpidament.\r\n\r\nHem estat 12 dies a l'apartament i, en general, ha estat molt positiu.",

        "txt": "This is a great little apartment on a quiet tree-lined street about two and a half blocks from the beach.  It is close to everything including the Siqueira Campos Metro stop which is a big plus if you need to get to downtown Rio. There are parts of Copacabana that are quite a trek from the Metro. There are all sorts of restaurants within a block in all directions and of course the beach a 5-minute walk away.\r\n\r\nEverything is brand new and the apartment feels modern and cozy at the same time. It is however quite small. I was there by myself for 4 nights and it was perfect. Great for a couple as well if you get along really well. I wouldn't try to put 3 people in this place. When the bed is unfolded there is very little floor space left. The little space there is actually feels a lot bigger because it is very organized. It is easy to keep tidy since there is really only one place to put each thing. The handy apartment guide shows you where things go, how to unfold the sofa into the various configurations, and has some tips on the area. \r\n\r\nThere is both wired and wireless Internet which was fast and worked perfectly for me. There is a nice little flat screen TV with satellite channels and easily accessible hdmi ports so you can hook up your laptop and play your own content. Sometimes wall-mounted flat screens make it really hard to get to the hdmi ports, but not in this case.\r\n\r\nNote that power outlets in Brazil come in about 4 different flavours and you can never really be sure whether it is 110V or 220V. So bring adapters and make sure anything you plug in won't be fried by being plugged into a 220V outlet. In this apartment all (and there are surprisingly many) the outlets are IEC-906-1 type plugs at 220V. It is 3-pronged but still 2-prong Europlug compatible so if you are coming from most of Europe you won't need adapters. If you are coming from North America, bring some regular US-Euro adapters.\r\n\r\nThe view of Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer statue) is especially nice at sunset and in the evening when it is lit up. There is a shot of it at sunset taken from the window of the apartment here: (Website hidden by Airbnb) \r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine were lightning quick to respond and made the process extremely smooth.\r\n\r\nAll in all this was a perfect and relaxing 4 nights in Copacabana for me.",

The creative design and artistic details are inspiringly put together. It is also wonderful because it is situated in the heart of Copa. Very close to the shops, the beach, the metro, and major tourist attractions. Location and design are the perfect combo to make your stay comfortable and rewarding!\r\n\r\nAlan is such a kind, polite and thoughtful person! I will not forget his kindness. He went above and beyond to make my stay a happy one. In fact, he went well and beyond my expectations of a land lord. He even helped me organise a taxi to leave and booked it for me. Alan also arranged to get the apartment cleaned mid-stay. I did not ask him to do this. In sum, you could not want nicer person to deal with! Alan is a rare gem! He responds to emails in a timely manner and is a generous, helpful and wonderful!  He thinks of everything to make your stay a happy one!\r\n\r\nThe apartment building is nice and the couple that work at the door and look after the cleaning are such warm, kind and beautiful Brazilian people!!! They helped me so much with many things. When I arrived my luggage was missing, so they rang the airport and even offered to drive me to the airport! They even helped me go shopping for electrical goods so I could use my computer. Outstanding kindness!!!  It was a joy to come and home and say hello to them on the way to the elevator. I will miss them very much!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is comfortable because every last detail has been very well considered. Coming from Australia, I found the internet speed very fast and easy to connect. The cable TV is excellent and nice to watch after a long day touring Rio! The kitchen is perfect and is a delightful place to make yummy breakfast etc. The bathroom is very well designed. While the living room and bedroom is a joy to be in due to the artwork and beautiful use of form and light. The use of colour in the studio is visually sophisticated and joyful. I really loved the use of design to create atmosphere and mixed with Brazilian art, this is a real treat to enjoy! Loved it!!!\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed dealing with Alan and Catherine. They are perfect hosts and I will be coming back to stay again for sure! Thank you so much Alan and Catherine for letting me stay in your beautiful home. I had the best time and will always remember how lovely your home and your wonderful kindness! \r\n\r\nThank you!!!!!! ",

Loved the location...short walk to the beach. Neighborhood was friendly and felt very safe. Alan and Catherine provided suggestions for places to visit and also stocked some key items in the fridge. Amazing!  If I return to Rio I would love to stay here again and recommend it to everyone.  ",

I am a newcomer to this fantastic forum and had no recommendations or much detail in my profile while the apartment that Alan and Catherine entrusted me with truly is their home in Rio. It is a lovely designed little gem in Copa. It is amazing to see how much thought this couple spent in developing this small apartment into a little home where everything just fits perfectly. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is light during day and the sofa transforms into a most comfortable bed at night. When I read the description of the apartment I initially had my doubts about the sleeper coach but chose this apartment as all other things just sounded perfect. Well, it turned out that the sleeper couch is as perfect as the apartment proved to be. The most comfortable sleeper I have ever experienced!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was recently totally renovated and is kept in such good shape that it still feels new. One of the apartment's big asset (apart from its beautiful furniture and interior) is the large shower! And of course the aircon for the hot Rio summer nights!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is nearby a vast range of fair, good and excellent restaurants and various supermarkets and shops.\r\n\r\nThe special treat is the welcome pack which allows you some time to study the wonderful recommendations and tips Allan and Catherine provide you with in a little info brochure to assist you in finding your own way in the surrounding area. Alan also offed a Kyle chat to assist me finding my way, but I found the info provided so detailed that this was not necessary.\r\n\r\nAs with most apartments in Rio, security is tops with a watchfull 24/7 door guard, who by the way is always keen to help where he can.\r\n\r\nThe Wifi is pleasantly fast and reliable! \r\n\r\nI can only recommend Alan's and Catherine's home in Rio. It is stable for short term, for long term, for business or for just visiting Copa (which, if i may stray off the point :) ) should be on everyones list of things to do while you still can!!!!!)\r\n\r\nThank Alan, thanks Catherine! Your apartment and I will meet gain :) !\r\n\r\n\r\n",

They were extremely fast in responding to our quires and we had a good few especially as it was over carnival (They even responded to out quires during our week in the apartment and helped us with a problem we were having booking flights to Iguazu falls). The studio is ideally situated in a very safe area (although we found nearly everywhere in Rio to be very safe) that is perfect for exploring Copacabana and the surrounding areas. The city itself can be somewhat overwhelming at first but Alan and Catherine’s starter and information packs gave us the confidence to venture all over they city without hesitation. Carnival is an amazing time to go and it is good to have somewhere private to go back to after a long day or night at a bloc party (which you will run into everywhere). As a first time couple using this site we could not have been more happy with the outcome and it really made our trip to Rio carnival one we will never forget. So all that’s left to say is go and in stay in Alan and Catherine’s beautiful apartment, don’t believe the negative things you hear about Rio and bring a wig or a hat for carnival as you wont see a local without one :)",

Already wary of what I had read about airport taxi, I wondered how we were going to deal with this one.  No problem, everything was promptly arranged with their trusted driver who was at the airport promptly with our name and a reaonsable cost. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is on a beautiful quaint street in the heart of Copacabana.  Building security is fantastic with trusted 24 hr porters,  restricted access to the floors.  We felt much safer than in a hotel -- but Rio  not to be construed as an unsafe city.  We felt fine everywhere we went.  The metro is clean and efficient.  \r\n\r\nEverything in the apartment is well organized and works.  The high speed internet permitted flawless (Hidden by Airbnb) calls at all hours - a great stress reliever when you're on business.\r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine responded immediately to al communications, offered tons of helpful information about the area, checked in frequently to see if anything needed.  Its just goes on and on.  In short, they \"get it\".   Its not about the apartment, rather the total experience. \r\n\r\nPut this on your A list and consider yourself lucky if it books..\r\n\r\nTom and Cecilia Kessler\r\nGuadalajara, Mexico",

The location is great too! About 5 minutes walk to the beach of Copacabana, and located in a safe neighborhood. The bus station to go to the Sugar Loaf is about 10 minutes walk and the subway and the supermarket are only 3 minutes walking distance. Ipanema is only a 30 minute walk or you can take the subway (2 stations). Catherine and Alan were very helpful in helping us organize our trip. They were very patient with all our questions and fast in responding emails. They also helped us book our transportation to the apartment and all went very smoothly. We also loved the handbook loaded with all sorts of recommendations. We tried out a few restaurants and were not disappointed. We also went to Churrascaria Carretao (10 minutes walk) as my husband loves grilled meat (very touristy, get there early to avoid the tourist buses!). The hotel Othon has a restaurant on the top floor with a beautiful view of the beach of Copacabana. The food is rather pricey but the view is definitely worth it! The restaurant Colombo in the Fort of Copacabana is supposed to be good too, unfortunately we ran out of time! There are some very nice markets on Sundays. When heading to the hippie market in Ipanema stop at this very small market off Avenida Atlantica just before the Fort of Capacabana! They sell great pastels and the best caldos de cane! There is also an information center on Copacabana only a few minutes  towards Leme... And all this in short walking distance from the studio! \r\nWe highly recommend this place!\r\n",

It is bigger than it looks like on the photos, very bright and clean. Maria and her husband are very very helpful and kind. They met us, gave us recommendations where to go and where to eat. We usually walked to the center because it is a nice, downhill walk and took a taxi back - just 5 euro or so. There is a nice park right behind the corner, a supermarket 5 minutes of walking away.

Communication from the very start was fast and detailed. Every question was answered, and our request to start our trip a little early was accommodated without any fuss. He also sent us a PDF guide with lots of pages on tips for restaurants, beaches, snorkeling, driving adventures etc. A lot of them we followed.\n\nThe apartment itself is exactly as advertised. Comfortable, well equipped with all the essential kitchen appliances and accessories. Air conditioning in the main living room, and portable air conditioning in the bedroom which worked a treat during our stay. The added extras such as beach chairs, beach mats and a drinks/food cooler was very much appreciated, and used every day. Parking is right at the front and easy to access. \n\nThe location is to die for. Having explored every part of this amazing Island we agreed that our favourite location was Kikei. The locals were very friendly, access to restaurants and supermarkets was just minutes away, and many of the Island learn to surf clinics (highly recommend doing this!) were run from a beach 5 minutes walk along the street. Every day we swam with turtles at the beaches immediately in the area of the apartment. You can literally walk out of the apartment, across the road and watch the sunset over the ocean every day. Amazing!\n\nI highly recommend this apartment and Thomas as a host.",

We thought it was very kind of him to do that. The only con was that the air conditioner is in the bedroom closet, and when the closet door is closed it’s okay. But when you open the closet door to let that cool air into the room, the AC is loud. So this made it a bit difficult to sleep through at night.

        "txt": "Yes! The room did look like from the pictures- the beds came in single twin beds, and even the comforter sets, the bedsheets were exactly like in the picture too! (even the curtains). \r\n\r\nI've to commend the room's cleanliness. One of the first few things that I noticed about the room when I stepped in was its clean floor- spick and span, I did not spot clumps of hair or the floor being covered in dust- that was one of the strengths of the room. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the toilet's floor was clean and there was no hair lying about the floor, or murky stains spotted about the toilet (not that I dared inspect every corner dilligently- but I stepped into the toilet barefooted, assured that it was clean)\r\n\r\nThey only provide basic body foam and shampoo, which are put into wall dispensers. I found the body soap to suffice but the shampoo was abit drying and so you might want to bring your own shampoo perhaps. \r\n\r\nCleanliness-wise, I give the sleeping area room + the toilets a 3.5 / 5 stars as I did not spot any dirt that irked me, the floors were clean enough to walk barefoot and they looked without dust. \r\nPerhaps, the only area which I did not walk barefoot much on was the doorway area as we were wearing shoes in and walking on it, during our first day. \r\n\r\nSpace-wise, it may be small, but mangeable for 2 people. I would say that it is just nice- roomy for 1 pax but just nice- slightly tight (depending on how spacey a room you are used to) for 2 people. Hong Kong is known for small room sizes though, so I thought this small room space is common.\r\nThe toilet is quite small though, and the places to hang your clothes/towels might not be as luxurious as hotels but we managed alright ultimately. There's not much space to move in the toilet. But its cleanliness and the reasonable price topped the space constraints! Bedroom wise , space is alright for 2 people.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the room window was the only difficult thing managing as it was abit hard closing it and some slight dust.\r\n\r\nTowels and linen smelt fresh! Bedsheets felt clean!\r\nYou need to request for towels. \r\nHost was very obliging, VERY, in answering all my many questions! I emailed her TONS. \r\nKeith & Joey were on duty when we were there and both are helpful, obliging people. Joey was very friendly and helped us to check which Karaoke places were cheap and the night bus to the airport! Their guesthouse is quite systematic I feel, with either Keith or Joey(lu xiao jie) on duty at different times of the day and they give you the number to call them with a phone hung outside the reception door. \r\nKeith answered any questions we had too! \r\nThey even provided us a SIM card with internet!\r\nTHANK YOU Athena, Keith&Joey! \r\nFor this price&cleanliness, it's worth.\r\n",

Her apartment is nothing short of amazing.  It is a great size for Hong Kong, incredibly comfortable, spotlessly clean and elegantly furnished.  The apartment is an an oasis from the hustle & bustle of Hong Kong.  It is perfectly situated on Hollywood Road, in the thick of a great selection of restaurants & bars and parks and is walking distance to Central & SOHO.  The apartment is open and airy, filled with natural light and is perfect for the business person that needs space to work out of or just to have a breather from the Hong Kong pace (a real luxury for Hong Kong).  The rooftop garden is a real bonus.  What a wonderful and unique experience.  I highly recommend this to any business person and discerning traveller.  I hope to return there soon.

Really enjoyed the neighborhood - it was fairly quiet at night, but just a few blocks to walk to the shops and restaurants along Hollywood Road (the art/artisan shops at PMQ were our favorite). The kitchen is well equipped and there are two grocery markets within a few minutes walk (one Chinese-style and one English-style), so it was easy to make breakfast each morning, open up the balcony doors, and listen to the birds chirping in the park across the street. Barbara was very helpful with suggestions on dinner places - she gave us 6 suggestions within a 5 minute walk; we made it to 5 and had a great meal each time. The Sheung Wan area is very convenient to Central and it's easy to pick up taxis, trams, and the MTR within a few blocks of the apartment to get anywhere in the city. We'd definitely book Barbara's place again if we return to Hong Kong.",

Despite such a crazily short notice Barbara immediately arranged a key for me to get in without any complaints. The 24hr doorman is always so nice. I didn’t have a chance to wander around but as far as I know restaurants, convenient stores or even hospital are all downstairs and IFC (the usual working place) is just 5-10min taxi away. I’ve had some terrible experience staying at Airbnb HK previously and switched back to the boring 5 star hotel mode since then. But I would now defo place Barbara’s apt as my top choice whenever I travel to HK. I would sincerely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a down-to-earth experience in HK esp those on business trips. Last word, the pano view is amazingly refreshing - you’ll know what I’m talking about if you are familiar with the HK housing conditions ;p",

It's hip, arty, and with just enough grit to make it feel like you're in New York not the theme park that tourists end up going to. Her apartment is close to trains, some great restaurants and grocery stores, and the building is really cool. We mostly stayed out, but when we stayed in we could cook and watch Netflix like we were home. I can not stress how comfy she has made it. I really felt like I was home.

It took some adjusting for us to hang out in the area.  The area is considered 'gritty' which is extremely true. I cant stress that enough. It is dirty, you might be bothered for spare change, you might be asked to swipe your metro card for someone,  however the area does have some of the coolest restaurants in the city. But you must go looking for them, otherwise you will only find corner deli's that don't take international credit cards and random pawn shops etc.  We actually loved our experience at Shannon's though. Shannon's studio was great. Lots of space for two. The only complaints we had were that the walls were paper thin and it was all around a bit dirty. We washed the dishes before using them since they were dusty and just kept a fan at night to block out noise. We also could not reach Shannon until the day of our reservation and had to wait past check in time to get the keys. Once we were in contact, Shannon was super nice and helpful. The roof top is amazing! You can see some of Manhatten's skyline. The subway takes about half an hour to get to Manhatten , once you are there, probably another 15 to wherever you want to go. It is nice to get away from the zoo of Manhatten, I strongly recommend staying in Brooklyn, it's gives you more of a well rounded experience.  For us, this was great, we loved the experience of what it would be like to live there.",

It’s a plus that you can also wash your dirty clothes and cook your own food!\nPeople in her neighborhood are very warm & friendly, they would smile back when you smile at them.

The living room connects to a kitchen and a balcony overlooking the garden where we enjoyed our meals. The garden was my favorite spot. It is not for those who love neatly arranged, engineered, and regularly maintained gardens. Sanem´s is an essentially picturesque garden with wild plants that look like being there for ages. There are regularized pockets where Sanem has planted tomatoes, cucumbers, and green peppers. I loved watering them. She graciously let us taste mulberries and plums. Four different plum trees, two different mulberry trees, a cherry tree, a sour cherry tree, fig tree, vines, roses, loquat, and of course the sublime pine tree partly covered by a delightful bougainvillea... Yes, this is still considered to be Istanbul. The notorious phaeton noises and manure smells of Büyükada stay away from this house. We only smelt flowers and post-rain soil, and heard beautiful seagulls whose concert sabotaged occasionally by gangs of crows plotting to take plums and mulberries away... Despite all its peacefulness, the house is not completely isolated: there are two small groceries and a restaurant just about fifty meters down the street. Sanem is a lovely person. She met us at the check-in, made sure we had a pleasant stay, and encouraged us to contact her anytime should there be any inconvenience, which never happened. Great house, dream garden.  ",

When we started our family, it was no longer practical to stay in hotels with limited space, compromise security with two separate hotel rooms and incur the food and beverage costs of our growing children. As business travelers we have had the opportunity to visit some of the most amazing cities but none of these locations have come close to the feeling of peace and serenity that we have found in Wailea. Grand Champions Villas is hands down the greatest value in all of Wailea. The central location, beautifully maintained grounds, security and space within the villas cannot be beat. The villa is perfected by a truly beautiful interior with a fresh, relaxing vibe. It was our goal to bring the beauty we saw in the grounds of Wailea to the interior of the villa where we spend time with our family creating cherished memories. We would love to share this magical place with you. Hula On In to Beach House Chic Style. With warmest aloha, Paul",

The condo's wifi connection gave us no problems, and the owners added the extra touch of giving us access to their netflix account allowing us to relax on the couch after our longs days out exploring. The kitchen was stocked with all the cutley, dishes and pots and pans we could need throughout our stay and dishwasher pods so we didn't have to take time away from vacationing :) The owners also provided us with plenty or towels and beach towels, and other amenities such as a blow dryer. Besides the beaches, I didn't feel that there was too much to do in the close vicinity, but I was still happy with the location as we had plenty of activities planned all over the island, and Waliea-Makena ended up being a relatively central point. I would definitely recommend this condo when your visiting Maui! Aloha :)",

When we arrived, Derek (the premise manager) welcomed us and everything looked nice, comfortable and clean. The location is also good (close to the A train station and the beach). \r\nHowever, it was not quiet during the night sleep. We were woken up by constant loud noises ( between 12am and 2:30am ) from the tenant family (apparently, who also rent and stay in the house but on a different floor or room). We had no choice but called Derek around 12:16am and later with SMS, but the situation was not under control. The tenant's kids kept speaking loudly and running around, we could not get any sleep between 12-2:30am at all. We felt exhausted and bad in the next morning due to disruptions of night sleep (remember, I also had 13miles race to run).  Definitely, it requires further improvements.",

When we had issues with the wifi, she immediately came over and sorted everything out, although it was already 8 or 8.30 in the evening. She also gave us a lot of information about restaurants, bars and sights in the area. All of her recommendations were really good too!\r\nWe had an amazing time in Sydney, thanks to our great host Vickie and her lovely apartment. We can definitely recommend this place! :)",

        "txt": "Do you want to have one of the best views in Istanbul while enjoying a glass of \"cay\" (turkish tea)? Is good communication to your host and a warm welcome important to you? Ever wanted to stay in an amazingly designed, old Istanbul-apartment? Then you found your location to stay! My friend and I, both of turkish decent, stayed in this apartment for a week during March (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Two days before our flight to Istanbuk, Chronis contacted us and gave us thorough information on address and what we should be careful about, like not being too loud with music for the sake of the neighbors. Furthermore he told us, that his assistant Ms. Margarita will welcome us at our arrival, since he was not in Istanbul during that time. He gave us Ms. Margaritas and his phonenumer to contact them upon arrival via phone or (Hidden by Airbnb) Messenger. After our arrival we contacted Ms. Margarita on (Hidden by Airbnb) and told her our approximate time of arrival in front of the apartment. She responded quickly. Upon arrival at the apartment we rang the bell of the flat, which Chronis told us in before and were quickly welcomed by Ms. Margarita. She gave us a very friendly and warm welcome and informed us on everything important about the flat. She had only prepared one bed in the big bedroom, since she assumed we'd be a couple. After having told her, that we need two seperate beds, the quickly prepared the second bed in the small bedroom, without any hesitation. Furthermore she informed us about possible issues like water failures, which is normal in Istanbul during this season, because of heavy rains and a bad water infrastructure. She even prepared water canisters in case, so that we could still finish the shower or use the toilet. Because it was already very late when we arrived, we agreed on asking further questions via phone or (Hidden by Airbnb) . The following days, she wrote us on (Hidden by Airbnb) to check if everything's ok. During our stay we made mostly good experiences with the flat. The most mentionable ones are the following: 1) The bed in the big bedroom is very comfy. 2) There are lots of fresh towels and duvet covers in case that you like to change very frequently. 3) The kitchen is equipped with everything needed for a decent meal. The stove is new and there is a dishwasher, if you like to use one. 4) The view from the living room is AMAZING! I doubt, you can find many other apartments with such a nice view in central Istanbul. 5) The water actually never failed ;) There were also some SMALLER points, which could improve. The most important ones: 1) The bed in the smaller bedroom is directy next to the radiator, which can make sleeping there during the cold season very hot. If you shut off the heating, the floor and flat itself can get quite cold, since it's an old building with wood battens. 2)...",

We were able to make the most of the beautiful beach in Wailea. We were able to park both of our hire cars right at the front door of the condo, which made getting around Maui so much easier. The condo is in a great location, only a 3 minute drive to the beach and a stroll to some great restaurants and shops. There is a supermarket 10 minutes up the road which was good to be able to make use of the fully equipped kitchen. The washing machine and dryer were a bonus. Jim was extremely efficient with all communications prior to and during our stay and made the entire trip a breeze. I would recommend this place for families wanting a relaxing holiday. ",

Appeared that host is not the actual home owner but rather part of a management company - not relevant for appartment. Kitchen had all utensils required but no basics such as sugar,salt etc. Good space in the appartment for a group and a great sitting room.

This was certainly unpleasant, but i guess it could happen anywhere.\r\n3. as others mentioned, sometimes smells were noticed in the bathrooms - it happened randomly through the day. i guess the building;s vent systems are not great.\r\n\r\nagain, these were minor things. we felt very comfortable otherwise. we also really appreciated the view and the location. the beds were comfortable too.",

      "about": "Four friends, a lot of dreams, a common path\r\n\r\nOporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.\r\n\r\nIt also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.\r\nOur project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.\r\nSo with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. \r\nIn addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nQuatro amigos, muitos sonhos, um caminho em comum\r\n\r\nOporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos: a Rosa, a Tânia, o Igor e o Nuno. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. \r\n\r\nO projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.\r\nEnvolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. \r\nO nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. \r\nAssim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. \r\nAcrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.\r\n\r\n ",

It's very close to the top platform of the Luis I bridge which give you the most beautyfuI view over the city and the river. The downhill walk to the Ribeira riverside is nice and just 5-10 Minutes.

It was the basement of their home with a lot of space and a half bathroom. Really relaxing experience with all the privacy you want, a large TV with Netflix and Amazon  for those who like to watch a nice movie when coming back from a long day in New York. The photos on airbnb are not really capturing how nicely decorated and well kept is the room. Nothing compared to other rooms I have seen in Astoria. The towels provided are of very good quality and very large, the wi-fi works perfectly and there is plenty of space for your things. To me and after seeing a lot of rooms, there is no doubt that this one is the best taking into consideration the space provided, the location and the price asked!\r\nThe neighborhood was again really pretty. Very safe with lots of shops for food and interesting markets. I had the feeling and really wanted to go back to Astoria and walk around after a busy day in Manhattan. 4min walk to 30th station and 16 min ride to Lex avenue and the upper east side which in my opinion is the best area in NY \r\nI can't say enough about Gabe and his mum. Their hospitality was awesome! I was welcomed with a lot of snacks, fruits and a bottle of wine waiting for me when I arrived and kept coming during my stay. Gabe was answering immediately to all my texts and tried to sort out anything I needed in order to feel more at home! But besides that the most important thing is that both of them are very interesting and well educated people. You can have a lot of discussions about lots of things and learn, which at least for me is very important! I think I made some friends in NYC, which by the way is a truly amazing city.\r\nHighly recommended, no need to look anywhere else! Thanks a lot guys.",

I keep a good home but Gabe clearly has a future career as interior decorator awaiting him.\r\n3) Plants! There's a garden of greenery spread around the apt.\r\n4) Everything useful is labeled, from the lightswitches to the recycling bin.\r\n5) There is a pre-sentient voice-activated music player in the living room. \"Alexa play some Jazz\". \"Alexa louder\". \"Alexa next\". I'll be getting one of these for myself, it's from Amazon apparently.\r\n\r\nHosts like Gabe make Airbnb amazing to use. I hope all my future hosts will be similarly excellent.\r\n",

Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on.

I moved from the UK to Australia in November 2015 with my boyfriend and we love living in Surry Hills.\r\nI'm very active; I enjoy the gym, running in Centennial Park and exploring all of the great walks around NSW and beyond. I volunteer for a women's charity and I'm also a Girl Guides leader.\r\nI love to cook but with the variety of amazing restaurants on our doorstep it's hard to not eat out all the time!\r\nAs both a guest and host I'm polite, considerate and tidy. I like for our guests to feel at home when they stay with us - so if there's anything you need, just ask.",

It is very unique, peaceful, serene, excellent for relaxing and meditation. The gingerbread is close to a cool little beach town called Paia and the Baldwin Beach Park. Thank you for letting us enjoy your beautiful property. We definitely recommend the Gingerbread House for couples!\nP.S. Don't bring an alarm clock, the roosters will be happy to wake you up in the morning!  ",

        "txt": "This was a wonderful experience! It was also our first time using Airbnb and visiting a Hawaiian Island and we would definitely do it all over again. Early in our planning we intentionally made the decision to avoid the big resorts and seek out something that felt a little more like the \"real\" Hawaii. Eve's rustic cabin provided just that. The cabin was clean and comfy, with a great amount of lighting and windows. One of my favorite parts of the cabin was the large window high above the kitchen that looks into the jungle across the stream. It almost looks like a framed painting every morning when you wakeup.  The chirping birds in the jungle made it that much better. The property is close to Makawao and Pa'ia, both of which have great dinning and shopping and a great small town feel. We still visited the big resort towns for the beaches which weren't too far away. A baby beach protected by a reef is also just 10 min away! We found the cabin to be a great central location to see just about everything on the island. \n\nTip: We bought the book \"Maui Revealed\" before we made this trip and used it religiously the entire time we were there. Kula Bistro is a must, Makawao fresh morning doughnuts in the white building with green trim and usually a line (it's quick I promise!) 808 Cafe has great food and is across the street from our favorite beaches. Drive to Hana takes all day if you go all the way around, but is so very worth it. Get out and see everything! Bring food!\nThe Gingerbread Cottage is a perfect central location to everything on the island, but far enough from the hustle of the towns. Be sure to do the labyrinth walks on the property, it's a great way to prepare your mind to enjoy your vacation, also go sit by the river and read a bit, it's very relaxing. We will be back next year!!!",

(which is great if you want to feel like a real person from Istanbul). The apartment is exactly like shown in the pictures. It is very clean and you have everything you need. All together it was a very nice stay and i can just highly recommend this apartment ! We will definitly book this apartment again if we come back to Istanbul!",

In terms of location it's within a stone's throw from the main shopping and nightlife of Taksim but enough out the way that it won't disturb your sleep. Restaurants, cash machines etc are all less than a five minute walk. It's barely a minute from the main road so you're not walking deep into a potentially dodgy neighbourhood. Do your (Hidden by Airbnb) maps homework before you get there and it's easy enough to find. \n\nI took the Havatas bus from Attaturk Airport which took around 50 mins and dropped me off in Taksim (Point hotel). From there it was about a 15/20 minute walk. If you come with suitcases however you'll want to get a cab as the pavements in Istanbul are not build for cases!

If you stay here, you must go have a bite to eat at Merhi, it's great place to have some traditional Turkish home-cooked foods. The Turkish rice pilaf is an instant favorite of ours now.

Currently two of our three grown-up children live with us and we have a spare room. We have always had guests in our house since the children were very little and it is something that we would like to continue doing as I believe connecting with other people and learning about different cultures is wonderful. \r\nWe love film, food, travel and music. This is a very musical household. Sport is also a very big thing- you will always find somebody watching the tennis/cricket/football on the television or going for a wok or bike ride. \r\nWe ourselves love Airbnb and have used it all over the world in recent years. In Canada, France, South America and of course all around here in Australia. \r\nMy life motto: you could die tomorrow so live life to the full! ",

During the 2 weeks, they just treat us as same as a part of the family, inviting us to their festival dinner, introducing us to their best friends. Every morning they would ask if it was a good sleep. Every evening, they would say good night before we go back to the room. \r\nIf ever I will go back to Sydney again, this would be my only choice. \r\n\r\n这是我在Airbnb中最最满意的一次住宿体验｡\r\n不仅仅这个地理位置很好,去市中心,悉尼歌剧院,门口的公交车直达｡而且周围的配套设施齐全,十分方便｡\r\nPaul一家人待客非常之好,如若对待家人｡一直给我们买牛奶,橙汁,谷物,蜂蜜等等｡尽可能地提供信息帮助我们｡\r\n只要去悉尼,对于住处,这永远会是我的第一,也是唯一的选择｡\r\n",

He took me on a tour of Rio on my first day and showed me everything to do in Rio. He was so accommodating and made me feel at home when I first arrived. Kayanh far exceeded my expectations. The home is so beautiful (I called it the tree house). The bedroom has everything- TV, fans, zoned air conditioning. The bathroom was awesome too. Everything was very well decorated and very clean. The neighborhood was great. It was in a very private, quiet neighborhood, close to the BRT and the area is very convenient, everything is in a walkable distance if you like walking. \r\n\r\nKayanh home is 35-40 min from the airport by car and 1 hour from Centro Brazil, if you do not mind travelling by public transportation all the tourist areas are accessible.   \r\n\r\nKayanh and his family are the best hosts that you could ever ask for. I only speak English, and Kayanh spoke Portuguese and English which was a tremendous advantage. \r\n\r\nKayanh and his family are 5 star hosts. ",

Fica no início da Rua São Salvador, portanto longe do barulho que pode vir da boêmia Praça São Salvador, dois quarteirões adiante, mas suficientemente perto de serviços de todo tipo (banco, mercados, correios, metrô, etc.). Os funcionários do prédio são simpáticos e, quando tivemos uma pequena reclamação de barulho em relação a um vizinho, o porteiro rapidamente resolveu-o, sem sequer ser necessário fazermos contato com a anfitriã a respeito. Só sentimos que uma parte da cozinha não condiz com o restante do apartamento, mas penso que a anfitriã deverá resolver isso em breve. O banho de chuveiro é excelente, os eletrodomésticos da cozinha e a máquina de lavar-secar são novos e muito bons, a iluminação é linda e o ar condicionado no quarto é bastante potente (talvez o suficiente para refrigerar o apartamento inteiro, mas não há como isolar a casa da área de serviço com tanque, que é aberta). Acabamos não conhecendo a Sonia, pois chegamos e saímos em horários inusuais, mas a chegada e a saída foram tranquilas mesmo assim e o contato (por (Hidden by Airbnb) ) correu de forma fluida e sempre que necessário (de ambas partes). Ficaríamos aqui de novo e recomendamos para quem queira um apartamento de quarto e sala confortável numa zona agradável, central e não cara do Rio de Janeiro.",

Tout d’abord, la rua do Almada, où elle se trouve, est une rue passionnante. Des boutiques vintage ou design, sont à côté d’autres endroits qui vendent des produits électriques pour artisans comme nous n’en voyons plus à Paris. Nous avons été si bien accueillis par Alexandra qui s’occupe de la maison. Elle parle un français parfait et l’anglais aussi. Elle nous a donné plein de bonnes informations pour profiter de Porto. La maison, elle-même est magnifique. Elle vient juste d’être rénovée. Nous avons adoré la pierre que la propriétaire a sauvegardée sous les fenêtres et autour des portes et les volets typiques à l’intérieur. La décoration est très soignée. Là aussi, un mix d’objets très design, comme la superbe lampe dans la cuisine ou dans le salon et des petits meubles vintage un peu partout, très beaux. La cuisine est un bonheur. On pouvait prendre notre petit déjeuner sur la terrasse qui donne sur un petit jardin adorable où l’on peut descendre par un large escalier. Nous avions un grand choix de vaisselle magnifique. Les chambres sont aussi très confortables. Chacune avait sa salle de bains. Mais le must, c’est les draps. Nous avons eu l’impression de dormir dans un hôtel 5 étoiles. Douillets et soyeux à souhait. J’aimerais avoir les mêmes chez moi ! La bibliothèque du salon contient plein de livres intéressants et une bonne collection de dvd. On s’est senti chez nous, avec un certain luxe en plus !

Sou amante de viagens, e gosto de andar de moto e fazer Snowboard. \r\n\r\nO projeto do Jurerê Loft nasceu de muitas idas à Ilha da Magia, e decidi que precisava de um bom motivo para voltar mais vezes. Decidi investir nos apartamentos assim que os vi. O Alex me apresentou cada um dos 4, me apaixonei e pensei: Porquê não transformar esses lofts em uma experiência mágica para os hóspedes do mundo todo? Até hoje o Alex me ajuda com a gestão do Airbnb e a cada comentário elogiando o local e nosso atendimento, me sinto de fato realizado.\r\n\r\nTudo que temos aprendido nesse tempo de Airbnb tem nos ensinado muito, e espero sempre oferecer uma excelente experiência na estadia dos nossos hóspedes!\r\n\r\nEstou sempre disponível para dúvidas sobre qualquer uma das cidades, dicas e sugestões (Sempre bem vindas).\r\n\r\nUm Grande Abraço!\r\n____________________________________\r\n",

The only drawbacks for us was the lack of kitchen staples (most rental homes include ample sugar, salt, olive oil bottles, etc) and some issues with electricity (the only way to turn on bedroom lights was via turning on the living room light as well and there was lacking useable sockets in the bedrooms). Otherwise, we had a great time and would definitely return with larger groups again.",

It's in Sai Kung, so its near to some scenic spots like Wong Tai Sin Temple, the seaside park and HK Heritage Museum in Shatin.\nAnd then the community. It's near the mtr, the gate is just the entrance to mtr. And it's safe, thanks to the guards, outsiders have no access to get in. The infrustructure is good and there are some entertainment facilities for the kids too.\nFinally it comes to the apartment. You can just find it home there, yeah a sweet home, from the window you can have a sea view. The power adapter is available.\nThat's it, it's a place where you would like to live for a second time.",

I walked to Mrs McQuarries point one day and it took just over an hour to do so, buses take 10-15 minutes to central. Paddington itself is a cute neighbourhood with some nice places to eat/drink/shop nearby. Quite a few steps to take up to the flat just for anyone who might have issues with that, I didn't.

Regardless he was there waiting for us and gave us a thorough explanation of the apartment, location and sites for us to visit.\r\n\r\nWe are a family of two adults and two children. The apartment is not really optimal for small children, because of the rickety staircase. But we made due with the sleeping arrangements on the first floor and had a great time.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is small but very nicely decorated and was exactly as described. The location is great. Just next to the Ponte Luís I bridge and the riverside restaurants. The apartment faces away from the water but this allows for a small terrace facing toward the cliff side, which was very nice for a spot of air. \r\n\r\nHugo also has a deal with a breakfast delivery service, whom left a beautiful basket outside our door. The service also catered to Hugos high service standard and replaced the coffee in our basket with chocolate milk, which was immensely more popular with our children.\r\n\r\nI can only give my best recommendation to both Hugo and the apartment. It is a beautiful space in a prime location at a semi affordable rate. We only gave slightly more than we would have paid for a cheap hotel and half of what we would have paid at a nice one.",

Everything was very accommodating.  However, one issue we had was our morning when we were leaving.  We were not told that the code to get into the front door and to our apartment would be voided exactly at noon.  We had to make a quick run to a shop just next door and got back to the apartment and could not get in.  We were 5 minutes late.   We finally got in and the cleaning crew was waiting for us with some very impatient faces.  We were all packed, we just had to toss a couple of things in a bag and leave.  We always tip cleaning crews, and this time we were able to hand the tip to them in person, which seemed to ameliorate the situation.  Otherwise, all went smoothly.

Judy was very nice and welcoming, providing a supply of breakfast staples as well as great hints about neighborhood cafes and restaurants.  My mother - always apprehensive about parking - was especially pleased that there is lots of free on-street parking available in the surrounding neighborhood.  Judy was easy to correspond with in advance and to connect with the day they arrived - she's very responsive, and even let me preview the space to ensure it would be accessible for my older parents. I hope the apartment is available the next time they visit Brooklyn - which they are excited to do as a result of a very restful, comfortable weekend.",

You can walk down Atlantic Avenue or State to get to Brooklyn Bridge Park (which is quite lovely!).  It's about a 10 minute walk.

The eye for detail throughout my family's stay was so helpful- from the instructions on every set of keys, printing out of maps and a binder full of recommendations, I'm definitely going to tell my friends to stay here in the future.  Judy is super easy to get a hold of and happily answered all of my questions. Thanks again, Judy! ",

Although the nearby avenue can be a bit loud at night, earplugs are provided, and the cool humming of the aircon happens to cover most of it.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is great ! Lively yet very safe. Within walking distance is the buzzing Fulton Mall, and the more elegant Smith St. and Court St. Plenty of restaurants, bars, bakeries and cafés. Judy and Sasha provided us with a list of their favorite places - Don't miss Van Leeuwen's unforgettable organic Ginger Ice Cream ! Catch the A and C lines at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station, one block away, and ride to downtown Manhattan in ten minutes... \r\n\r\nJudy and Sasha are discreet hosts, yet very caring. We've been texting prior to our arrival and while we were staying there. They dealt with any little issue in a swift and elegant manner. We really felt like we had settled in Brooklyn for a week, and have left NYC with unforgettable memories. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nL'appartement de Judy et Sasha est propre, plus grand que sur les photos, bien équipé et décoré avec goût. Judy et Sasha ont tout fait pour que notre fils de deux ans puisse dormir avec nous dans la chambre sur un vrai matelas. Le bruit de l'avenue peut déranger, surtout la nuit, mais le ronronnement de la clim couvre le plus gros. \r\nLe quartier est super : d'un côté, Fulton Mall fourmille, et de l'autre, Smith St. et Court St. sont plus élégantes. Le quartier regorge de restos, cafés, bars et boulangeries. Sasha et Judy fournissent une liste de leurs endroits préférés. A un pâté de maison, vous trouverez les lignes A et C à la station Hoyt Schermerhorn, qui vous emmène dans le Sud de Manhattan en dix minutes...\r\nJudy et Sasha sont des hôtes discrets et prévenants. Nous avons échangé par texto avant notre arrivé et pendant notre séjour. Ils ont répondu à toutes nos demandes avec réactivité et élégance. Nous avons vraiment eu l'impression d'habiter Brooklyn le temps d'une semaine et avons quitté NYC avec des souvenirs inoubliables...",

There are also some nice restaurants, bars, bakeries and cafés. Check out Bacchus! Its a nice french restaurant close to the corner of Bond St. and Atlantic Ave. And for midnight munchies there are a few 24 hour convenience stores near by. It is also worth mentioning that the apartment is within walking distance to the bustling Fulton Mall stretch, where you can find good buys.\r\n\r\nI found the Hoyt-Schermerhorn subway station to be very convenient as it was very close to the apartment. You can catch both the A and C lines which will take you in and out of Manhattan in about 10 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nJudy was a joy to deal with and I thank her for her hospitality. She answered my questions swiftly and responded to a slight glitch in the internet quickly which was a great help. Even though I was only in New York City for 4 days, I felt like I was just settling in and enjoying all that New York City had to offer.

He made sure the condo was very clean before we arrived, was able to meet us to explain how the condo worked, answer any questions we had, and left us with restaurant recommendations. Todd was quick to respond to all communication before and during our stay. We truly enjoyed staying in his condo; the layout was great, decor BEAUTIFUL, and location was really nice. The condo was equipped with extra bedding, towels, dishes and utensils, plenty of storage space, and beach equipment. This place definitely felt like a home away from home (bonus: just steps away from the beach!). One note: Please keep the kitchen counters clean or sugar ants will find your crumbs, they weren't an issue though. \nMy mum and I were more than comfortable, and would love to stay here again on a future trip!",

The kitchen is very well equipped if you want to do some cooking or even prepare your own smoothies with fresh island produce. A lot of restaurants and cafes are in walking distance and Todd gave us some very good recommendations. A highlight for me was also that all beach equipment (towels, chairs, sunshade and snorkeling gear) is available for two (especially handy when only arriving with carry-on luggage. Overall we could not have asked for a better apartment to enjoy our Maui vacation. For those interested, there is a surf school who rents out boards right across the street and you can always watch some surfers at the beach in front of the building.",

The view of the ocean from the balcony was amazing. Overall, I had a fantastic stay considering the area and the condo. I visited friends in Wailea who stayed at a resort and condo, but still I preferred Todd's place and Kihei because of the ambiance, amenities (e.g. beach gear!), proximity to beaches, restaurants and vibe.

También a unos cuantos metros puedes coger el metro que te deja en la parte alta del centro de Oporto pero es bastante ruidoso.\r\nEl piso está muy bien para los que quieren combinar playa con ambiente de la ciudad de Oporto.\r\nNosotros íbamos en familia con niños (12-14) y nos encajó bien. Pasamos un par de días en Oporto (pateada, paseo en barco, funicular, telesférico, tranvía...) y otros dos en Matoshinos y en Leca da Palmeira (surf, piscinas de mar, baños...). El agua del mar fría, conviene neopreno.\r\nBueno, que hemos pasado unos días estupendos y entretenidos.\r\nFelicidades a los portugueses por hablar inglés y más o menos español y hacerse entender.

      "about": "Olá,\r\n\r\nEstou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMinha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!\r\n\r\nMeus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). \r\n\r\nTopei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!\r\n\r\nFiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.\r\n\r\nMeu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! \r\n\r\nObrigado pela atenção!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMy experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!\r\n\r\nMy friends and family noticed how well my \"business\" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).\r\n\r\nI accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!\r\n\r\nI took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nComments from my guests:\r\n\r\n“This apartment is in the most amazing location. Leblon is beautiful, safe, and packed with fabulous restaurants. The apartment is just by the ocean - couldn't really be better. Communicating with Fabio was super-easy. He was really responsive and helpful. We are missing it already!” - Ed Pilkington (UK)\r\n“Fabio goes far and beyond the average host, my trip was a day earlier than I booked and I would have been stuck with no place to stay but Fabio personally went out of his way to get the place ready for me, great guy and will always go to him first when traveling to Rio. Thank again Fabio abs!!” - Darren Sanford (USA)\r\n“O apartamento é lindo como nas fotos e a localização é perfeita! O Fábio é super atencioso e respondeu super rápido nossas dúvidas. Recomendo muito!” - Bruna Ferrary Deniz (Brasil)\r\n“The apartment was better than we could have imagined. The photos don't do it justice. The place is huge, in a great location. Fabio was a very accommodating host. I would definitely stay there again.” - Jordan Giordano (USA)\r\n“Our stay at Fabio’s place was fantastic! The apartment is simply beautiful and it made us feel at home. Super stylish and cozy. We are very particular about the properties we stay at, and this one exceeded our expectations The apartment description was very accurate! We loved being so close to the beach and all the great restaurants around. Thank you very much!”- Pablo Perez (Canadá)\r\n“Fabio was a perfect host.  He answered promptly all our questions and is a really nice guy!”- Daniela (Brasil)\r\n “Fabio is the perfect host. Friendly and extremely helpful”.- Soren (Denmark)\r\n “It is really difficult for me to put down in words how grateful I am to Fabio! He is a wonderful host and a GREAT person!”- Justine (Dubai)\r\n“Más que anfitriones, hicimos una linda amistad. Gracias por todo... “- Leo y Aura (Colombia)\r\n“Fabio is a very friendly and considerate person and clearly takes great care of the apartment”.- Jonathan (Spain)\r\n“New to Rio? You should definitely speak to these guys.”- Vitaly (Russia)\r\n “Fabio is an amazing host with a deep concern for his guests' comfort. We feel that we now have a good friend in Rio!”- Ali (Canada)\r\n",

The water was hot, the wi-fi worked perfectly. The only negative that I had about the room was the noise. \r\n\r\nThe unit is situated on the 2nd floor of the building right outside a busy street. Every night around midnight, two bars would open up across the and start blaring music. The music would not stop until 8am the next morning. I ended up having to buy a white noise machine just to last through the night.\r\n\r\nThe only other feedback I had was around Fabio, the host. All of the reviews mentioned how responsive and helpful he was. However that was not the case for me. The day I booked, I couldn't get him to respond to the booking. I even had to have AirBnB call him. And then I asked him about touring the city. Instead of offering, he pointed me to a few self serve options. When I asked again, he said he would plan a trip then never responded. When I responded to him, he said he was too busy and my trip was over. \r\n\r\nFabio being my tour guide is not a huge requirement, but I had thought he would be more willing (or suggest someone), given the feedback people had for him o this site.\r\n\r\nAll in all, great place if you don't mind the noise and don't need a helpful host.

(ii) Even though in midtown, the neighbourhood is tranquil, neat, charming and not noisy. (iii) For New York standards, the apartment is big. Please consider -if you have never been in New York- that places size tend to be quite small in Manhattan. Space is a luxury in the city. (iv) The apartment is on a first floor which is quite helpful as New York's buildings sometimes do not have elevator (you should always ask if there is one if you are renting an apartment). (v) The apartment has one living - dining room, a small kitchen, two bedrooms and two bathrooms. I will not recommend it for more than 4 people. One bedroom is located on the first floor and the second one is located in the basement. (vi) The apartment is cozy. It looks like in the pictures. (vii) The patio is lovely. It is very unusual to find an apartment with its own access to a patio in New York. (vii) The beds are quite comfortable. I travel a lot and stay in several 4-5 stars hotels. The beds were as comfortable as the ones I find in my trips. 3. Matters to be considered: (i) Being the apartment in an old building you can hear the noise of your neighbours, particularly at night, which may cause troubles for having a restful sleep. My parents, who stayed on the first floor, were awaken some nights for the noise coming from the second floor (around midnight, apparently they move furnitures). (ii) The room located in the basement is particularly noisy at nights. It is next to a corridor where the washing machines are located and which also provides access to the patio. As I slept in that room, I needed to wear ear-plugs for not to be awaken at nights. However, one night not even the ear-plugs helped. I heart people walking and talking in the corridor very late that night. I walked up scared as I thought there was actually somebody in my room! (iii) The door in the basement needs curtains. In fact, there is one door which provides access to the patio with a window which allows people in the patio to see...",

Er hat uns vom Flughafen zu unserer Unterkunft und wieder zurück zum Flughafen mit seinem Auto gebracht und zwar gratis. Er wollte einfach nichts von uns nehmen. Für die Stadteroberung haben wir ebenso gratis zwei Fahrräder bekommen. \r\nDie Wohnung befindet sich in einer sehr guten Lage, bis zum Strand braucht man weniger als 15 min. Die Wohnung ist sehr schön eingerichtet mit einem Balkon mit tollem Ausblick über die Stadt. Der Gastgeber war fast nie in der Wohnung und wenn er kurz da ist war er sehr hilfreich und hat uns insider Tipps gegeben. Zum Schlafen hat er ein eigenes Zimmer mit eigenem Bad und WC, somit komplett getrennt von uns. Ganz ehrlich kann ich diese Unterkunft jedem empfehlen und ich hoffe wir werden wieder mal Froilans Gäste sein :)",

The room and amenities are very clean, with extra towels and sheets in the cupboard, should you need them. I was worried about heating since it's winter and the listing didn't have heating ticked, but they provided a thermostat heater that kept us nice and cosy. Another cute thing to note was the deco. There's an adorable kiwi bird toy and some binoculars that we took advantage of with the great view from the window. Also, go up to the terrace! You definitely won't be disappointed at Maria's :)",

It's in a smaller complex, with nobody above you. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is okay; appeared to be safe, and there are some eating/shopping options close by, but most restaurants and shops you may want to go to are a little further afield, but not more than a 3-5 minute drive (Kaanapali itself is about 10 minutes away, which is a good thing in my opinion). The road the complex is on is fairly busy, but not too noisy (most cars are going pretty slow here), see more below.\r\n\r\nThe complex itself is pretty old but appeared to be very well-maintained. There's a small beach adjacent to the complex that's okay for recreational bathing but not a destination in itself. The overall vibe was very private and intimate; a very friendly atmosphere. The pool was a huge added bonus for us; the kids wanted to use it practically every day. Honokowai Park was on the other side of the complex; we didn't go here, but the recon I did on a walk gave me the impression that the park was okay but nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nThe overall noise level here was very minimal; no loud guests or screaming kids. There is some road noise in the front bedroom, and although I wasn't in that bedroom, it wouldn't have bugged me, and I'm a light sleeper. \r\n\r\nThe baths were very nice and almost resort-y; overall, they were very clean although the grout could use a good cleaning, just saying. The kitchen was more than adequate for our needs, and had quite a bit of storage space. We also used the barbecues on premise a couple of times; they're impeccably maintained.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that is a drawback to this place in my opinion is that the loft can get quite stuffy, even with the fans going full blast. We were there in August, and several nights up there were fine, some others were uncomfortable, and there was 2 nights where it was extremely hard to sleep up there.\r\n\r\nSo overall, this place is perfect if you value a tranquil atmosphere with a killer view, in a nice unit in a pleasant complex, at a fair price. If you have enough guests to where you have to utilize the loft, the weather may be a roll of the dice as to how comfortable it is.",

The only thing i wish is this place had an AC coz the afternoons were very warm and the apartment felt like an oven. Nights get cooler though. We will be definitely going back again.

Located in Causeway Bay, there are tons of shops around and you are easily within walking distance to michelin star rated dim sum (at which we ate at twice in four days). Susann and Alessandra were extremely thorough, with an extensive helpbook provided to cover all your needs from dry cleaning to police to food.

Check in was easy as a representative from our host met us at the door, let us in and showed us around. The location was awesome. Literally steps away were many restaurants, shops and other places to go. There is even a small food market 3 doors down on the same street. The main square was a 5 minute walk.

Jenkin is an accessible and attentive host, and that's something you may need in a complicated city like Hong Kong. This is an efficiently designed very small space which makes it seem larger than it is. The layout is (1) a bed-sized sleeping area with a curtain and sliding door for privacy; (2) a comfortably sized and appointed bathroom with a nicely tiled shower with plenty of hot water and strong water pressure; and (3) a living room with comfortable sofa, reliable wifi, and clothes hanging rack. There is a fridge and microwave and hotplate, with enough cookware for two people. You wash your dishes in the bathroom.  All three rooms are recently remodeled and tiled.  The bed is very comfortable. Both the bedroom and living room have air conditioners.\r\n\r\nThe little apartment is on the 6th floor of an old and dingy (but clean) Kowloon apartment building one block from the stunning fountains of Kowloon Park and the subway, and a million places right there in your face.  It is a 10 minute exciting walk (as in every single time its exciting) to the picturesque  harbor ferry to Hong Kong Island (or you can take the subway there).  Like many Asian buildings, the elevators are very slow and often crowded with friendly people, but remarkably, each floor has an elevator on either end of the hallway. You walk out of Jenkin's apartment, look left and look right to see which elevator will arrive first, a fun little game for us. \r\n\r\nThe very safe neighborhood is extremely trendy, filled with excited locals and tourists, and many places open until late. (My favorite bar and restaurant were open until 3am, both very funky). \r\n\r\nI might stay in one of Jenkin's larger units next time but, you know, I'm not sure since this little place just grows on you after two days.  He is a master host, his cleaning lady is so nice and right nearby, and he takes a lot of pride in making your stay high quality.  He even guided our taxi driver to the front door by cell phone, and he is always, always accessible.  It's remarkable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The MTR station is right outside the building entrance, and the harbor area is just a few blocks away to the south and west. The living space is small but well organized, with a separate bedroom (just big enough for the bed) with its own air-con, and the bathroom is a very usable size. The main drawback to the apartment is that it is on the 6th floor of a 15 floor building and the queues can get long for the elevator. There is one elevator at each end of the long hall on the 6th floor but on the ground level they are completely separated.  A few times I waited on the ground floor in a queue for 15-20 minutes and the elevator fills up before being able to get in, so plan your trips, don't expect to go in and out a lot, and avoid mid-day and evening hours when people are coming home.  Of course this is not an issue the host can resolve, but I think any guests should anticipate.",

Sonntags sind wir zusammen zum Bio Bazar gelaufen und an einigen Tagen kochen wir sogar was zusammen.  Mein Zimmer befindet sich im obersten Stock, wo ich komplett meine Ruhe habe. gegenüber von meinem Zimmer ist eine wunderschöne Terasse, die zum Yoga machen oder ein Buch lesen einlädt. Gäste sind auch immer willkommen. Fatma hat ihre eigenen Stil, welches dem ganzen Haus, bis auf den Eingangsbereich, einen unglaublichen charm gibt. Jedes Zimmer ist individuell und man muss sagen, dass bis her die Leute, die ich im Haus kennengelernt habe, echt toll sind. Wenn man sich für Fatma entscheidet, sollte man auf alle Fälle kulturoffen sein und sich diesem schönen antiken Stil und der Nostalgie einfach fallen lassen. Ich bin durch Fatma und durch die Wohnung in einem alten Istanbul angekommen und fühle mich super wohl. Zu meiner Arbeit in Cihangir laufe ich täglich zu Fuß. Die Lage ist sehr perfekt. Ich brauche kaum Bus oder Bahn zu benutzen, da ich alles in Beyoglu und Taksim finde, was ich brauche. Nur für meine Touristentour habe ich lediglich die Bahn benutzt. Obwohl man zum Eminönu auch zu Fuß laufen kann, wenn man spazieren gehen mag. Ich danke Dir, Fatma abla, so wie ich dich gerne zu nennen pflege, für Deine Offenheit und Deine Wärme. Ich werde Dich sehr bald wieder besuchen kommen und hoffentlich sogar mein altes Zimmer beziehen im obersten Stock. ",

I stayed for 3 months and loved every second of it, only regretting that I could not stay for another three. The landlords are fantastic and experienced Airbnb hosts, which makes the experienced that much better. Fatma is an outstanding cook, and one should not miss a chance to dine with her and Hasan! The house is great, very typical and nice - as a bonus, the bathrooms were all renovated and they look fantastic. The terrace made for many evenings relaxing away from the hustle and bustle of Istiklal St. In terms of location, the house is in a great spot: seconds away from Istiklal, minutes from Taksim and the cool Cihangir area, and a short train ride or longer walk to Sultanahmet, Topkapi and all the tourist sites. Would recommend without any hesitation, as I already did to two friends of mine who also stayed at Fatma and Hasan's house. ",

The street where the house is on is pretty calm. \r\nThis room is on the same floor with the terrasse and the kitchen, so you have ideal access to both of them. The kitchen is ideal if you just want to cook something small from time to time as there's only one cooking plate.\r\nThis room is perfect for people that wish to be in contact with the host and exchange with them from time to time as you walk by their living room and kitchen as well as share the bathroom with them. If you rather be a little more to your own and mind cigarette smoke, I recommend one of the other rooms.\r\nFatma and Hasan are both very very nice, always asked about my day and they were very patient when I tried to say something in turkish. I hope that my turkish will be better one day so that we can have longer and deeper conversations!  They made me feel very welcomed and I also really enjoyed meeting Fatma's daughter and grandson!They are very generous, sometimes invited me for tea or something to eat. I also got lucky to taste some of Fatma's amazing food! ",

The room itself is super cute, with its own kitchen and terrace access, which I tremendously enjoyed as it gave me the sense of having an entire apartment. The neighbourhood is a bit off the tourist track but for that reason very charming. And it still is very close to Istiqlal, essentially just across the street. So you are strategically located. ",

      "about": "Aloha: This Kihei Bay Surf spacious, comfortable studio suite is across the street from the ocean. Its ideal location in North Kihei is close to restaurants, many beaches, and interesting activities. From your lanai, you will see an ancient Hawaiian fish pond where green sea turtles sometimes come to bask; there is a quiet, shaded park, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (the only sanctuary dedicated to to humpback whales), and an awesome Indian restaurant right on the ocean. Located near the beginning of the longest uninterrupted white sand beach in the whole state, you can run (or walk) from our unit all the way (six miles -in front of Kihei Canoe Club, Maui Canoe Club and a few condos to the protected area along the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge and board walk) to Maalaea Harbor (with the excellent Maui Ocean Center, Maui Golf & Sports park for the kids, many restaurants, Pacific Whale Foundation - and a bus stop to deliver you back in front of Kihei Bay Surf. Our complex has a good swimming pool, hot jacuzzi, tennis courts, BBQ area, and clean laundry facilities. \r\n\r\nOur corner unit is bigger and has more light than most of the other units in our complex. The wrap-around lanai offers more space than the other units as well. It has a queen bed and a sofa couch for sleeping. The unit has been renovated and upgraded several times since my mom first lived there when she arrived on Maui from Chicago in 1985 to teach English at Maui College. She loved her job and Kihei -- and she met a nice, handsome counsellor working at the college. They got married - and had me. \r\n\r\nAnd I just got married in August to my beautiful bride, who has a 8-year-old son. We feel very blessed. And we hope to share our love of place with you. \r\n\r\nAt KBS, you will be close to Kihei Canoe Club, where both my mom and I have done competitive outrigger canoe paddling. You can experience being out on the water if you go to the KCC Visitor Paddle on Tuesday or Thursday morning. Get there by 7:15 am to make sure you get a spot. During the winter, you may see whales while you are on the water. Allow a couple of hours for the experience. My mom is a volunteer for the HIHWNMS - the free museum and whale sanctuary across the street. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can hear a free lecture from 11am until noon about the Humpback Whales. The museum is open from 10am-3pm, Monday-Friday, and on the last Saturday of the month from 10am-1pm. The mission is to educate the public and protect humpback whales and other marine life and our environment. \r\n\r\nAnother activity that is nearby is Hawaiian singing, ukulele, and hula on Thursday nights from 7-8:30 pm. at the Keolahou Church, 177 S. Kihei Rd. It is joyful - and a glimpse of Hawaiian culture. \r\n\r\nCome stay. We think you will have a wonderful time.",

There were also two sets of snorkel gear which was great since we left one of ours at home accidentally. The beach towels were great too since they take up room when you bring your own. We enjoyed spending time by the pool and right across the road is a great park with a perfect swimming spot for kids. On our last day we had a late flight out and asked if we could stay a bit later so we could shower after the beach and John was very accommodating.

A wrap around balcony which is perfect for a glass of wine at sunset! Ideal for drying clothes also! Screen doors back and front meant a breeze could run through the apartment. \nSwimming pool was really clean as was the hot tub and well looked after by the on site manager, Mark. The pool wasn't that busy so we felt like it was our own private pool on several occasions! There was a barbeque area beside the pool which was great to use on those evenings we didn't feel like going out for dinner! A laundry room was also situated beside the tennis courts. \nThe location on Kihei was great, we had a beach right across the road that we could see from our balcony. No matter where you're  staying in Maui a car would definitely be necessary. John recommended Kihei car rental which turned out to be a fraction of the cost of an airport rental! A shuttle bus runs to the airport also from there. \nMonsoon Indian(restaurant)for any Indian lovers is directly across the road and was recommended by Johns dad to try it out, it was so good we went there twice! \nSnorkelers- there are so many great snorkelling beaches within a ten minute drive(by car)! \nMolokini + Turtle town-definitely a must!! \nThe Road to Hana- beautiful scenery and waterfalls I would advise camping along the route as there is so much to see in just one day!! The road is quite windy and narrow! \nDefinitely go to Hookipa beach near Paia if you want to see turtles basking around 17.00hrs! \nWe can't wait to visit Maui again next year and were hoping John will have a free space for us in his condo!! I can't thank John and family enough for their hospitality :) ",

We had a bit of trouble checking-in, since we didn't have the apartment number in the information provided to us. That was not Tara's fault though.. When you come here, just make sure you get all of the neccessary info in advance from airbnb. The aparment was clean and well-kept and communication with Tara was easy and quick. She let us check out pretty late (3pm), which we really really appreciated! The only thing we didn't love about the place was that there sometimes was a bit of an odor coming out of the bathroom.. I'm pretty sure that isn't Tara's fault either though, it must be a problem with old plumbing. But there is a window in the shower, so it's very easy to just air-out the bathroom with the door closed!\nOver all we are very very happy with our stay at Tara's place and would definitely come again:)",

And Tara’s communiques we’re friendly and informative, but never intrusive or inflexible. I highly recommend this Cameo Court apartment as the place to stay as you enjoy all that the Midlevels has to offer.",

We felt safe and cozy, and the building was quiet at night for restful sleep. Tara was very easy to get in touch with and provided responses quickly. I loved the location—super walkable to great restaurants, the zoo, Victoria Peak, and lots of public transit—but beware, if it is your first time to HK island and you want to walk from the subway/ferry, (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps won’t show you the amazing escalators and walkways that will make getting there a breeze, and you might get stuck carting luggage up many flights of stairs (as we did). I highly recommend staying here if you want to experience HK island like a local. Just remember to research the walking path, or take an alternate form of transportation if you’ve got heavy luggage!",

It is one street up from the hustle and bustle of the Soho district, in an area that is more upscale, largely quiet and family oriented.

Although I was quite confident from their profile before my arrival, the quality of my stay was even beyond my high expectations. Aurora and Alberto confirmed they are the ideal hosts, and their house and garden were the ideal place to stay. I arrived with an empty stomach, and Aurora took me to one of the neighborhood restaurants and explained the menu in English (6 Euros for everything). After lunch, Alberto showed me all flowers and trees in the garden and later he had set up the hammock between the trees. I relaxed myself in the peaceful atmosphere with birds chirping among the fragrant orange and jasmine blossoms. During the stay, my friend, Emma and I received more than what we needed: beautifully decorated room and bathroom, delicious daily breakfast (sometimes in their lovely garden), good recommendations for restaurants and 1 day trips to nearby towns (they had prepared to give us all the information we need before we arrived). They learned my precise breakfast request in one day and prepared perfectly for the rest of my 11 day-stay. Also we enjoyed their yoga classes in the studio which is located in the basement with the window opening out to the garden. They sometimes offered me the fresh vegetable-and-fruit juice and yummy soup (They are vegetarians). On Sunday, when they have no classes, they offered us to drive around town. The highlight of the tour was the museum which also has a huge garden. Alberto knows all the flowers and plants, and has a lot of stories about almost everything. I shared their tastes and felt they were my friends for years. I totally recommend this place and will come back in the near future for a longer stay. Machiko",

Given, it was my fault for not checking the listing, and although I thought we wouldn't survive a night there, you felt a nice cool breeze when you opened both front and back doors so the AC wasn't needed after all.  (One of the neighbors came to yell at me because one of the babies was crying so I had to keep the door shut) The location was perfect! It was walking distance to the very popular breakfast spot \"The Gazebo\" and to the Napili Bay that is very beautiful and you can see turtles.  There were a couple of issues with roaches, but it's inevitable considering they are condos and not everyone that lives in a complex is clean, although the condo was.  We would stay there again ",

        "txt": "\nLocation:\nA place looks as expected, 5 min from Kapalua Beach.  We didn't have any issues with neighborhood  condos. Despite there are a lot of people in this Condo Complex (Napili Ridge), we didn't feel the place to be crowdy (as well as elsewhere in Hawaii). While the most interesting activities (IMHO) are in Lahaina, there is just 12-15 min drive. You can drive elsewhere on Maui within 3.5-4 hours (one way).\n____________________________________________________________________\nFacilities/Equipment:\nIt really looks recently renovated, all facilities and equipment are good. There is a fridge, microwave and regular oven, plates and silverware. We enjoyed having breakfast on Patio with a nice garden view. Parking lots are not the issue - you just need to fill the form and submit it to management office.\n____________________________________________________________________\nCleanliness:\nThe place was clean as expected. Host provided to us beach and bathroom towels which was greatly appreciated\n____________________________________________________________________\nOverall\nGreat value-for-money deal for Hawaii travelers who don't want to spend tons of money for vacation. Note that rental car is required in most cases when travelling to Maui.",
